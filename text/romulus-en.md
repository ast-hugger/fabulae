# The Final Mystery of Romulus

## Chapter I: Rumor and Doubt

In the thirty-seventh year after the founding of the city, a wondrous rumor spread through all of Rome like wildfire: Romulus, founder and king of the city, had been taken by the god Mars, ascending into the heavens! The people, from the commoners to the senators, received this news in the streets and forums, some cheering in exultation, others shedding tears in reverence. The Senate itself confirmed this story with official declarations, asserting that Romulus had now become a god and would forever watch over his city.

I, Gaius Flavius, was recounting these events to my friend Marcus Terentius Crispus when I noticed a faint hint of doubt on his face. “Crispus,” I said, “does this not seem marvelous to you? I can imagine it now: Romulus, lifted through a break in the clouds, surrounded by flashes of light; the people prostrate on the ground, averting their eyes from the divine radiance. And since Marcellus himself, the tribune, claimed to have seen the cloud rise to the heavens, who could doubt it?”

Crispus, however, raised his gaze and fixed his perceptive eyes on me. In a low voice, he replied, “Flavius, the story is indeed remarkable, but why has it spread so quickly throughout the city? Nothing on its own could take root in public opinion so swiftly or with such unshakable confidence. Yet here we are, with all of Rome united in belief, as though no one could conceive of it being anything but the truth.”

Somewhat uncertain, I replied, “But surely this is a sign of divinity, Crispus—that with no delay, no hesitation, this vision is set firmly in the people’s minds.” Yet I noticed him watching me more closely, a faint, ironic smile barely concealed.

“Flavius,” he said, “Rome is inclined to believe rumors, but a sudden ascension like this, of their own king, would never have been so quickly accepted without some delay, unless the Senate itself had urged the people toward faith in it. There is no proof at all except the senators’ words. And none but those nearest to him in the Senate even saw this ‘ascension.’”

Crispus’s words made me uneasy; it was true, now that I considered it, that the Senate had proclaimed this story to the people so swiftly, so immediately, and so unanimously, almost as if to extinguish any questions in the minds of the people. Yet Crispus still smiled faintly, as though more were left unsaid.

After a brief silence, Crispus added, in a slightly more serious tone, “This, Flavius, which has been impressed so firmly upon the people, sounds to me less like the intervention of Mars and more like the craft of the Senate. If we seek not what is spoken but what is concealed, we may be led to the hidden truth.”

## Chapter II: Traces in the Campus Martius

Early in the morning after the rumor of the prodigy had spread throughout Rome, Crispus and I made our way to the Campus Martius, where, as the story went, Romulus had been taken up into the heavens. The vast and famous Campus Martius lay serene in the dawn’s light, with the Tiber flowing gently along its banks, a silent witness to recent events. The quiet of the place lent a sense of mystery, but Crispus, with his sharp mind, brushed this aside.

“Rumors are rarely true,” Crispus murmured as we approached the site of the miracle. “But perhaps the place itself holds some significance, if we examine it carefully.”

In the area where Romulus was said to have vanished, Crispus cast his sharp eyes all around, searching for any trace. Pressed grass, broken bushes—it seemed as though some kind of struggle had taken place there not long ago. The signs were unclear, but Crispus examined each one. Still, I reflected aloud, almost in doubt, “Surely, my dear Crispus, you think there was a crowd of people here? Certainly, one would expect the traces of many people in such a spot.”

Crispus, however, raised a fragment of purple cloth he had found among the bushes and shook his head slightly. “Not all traces, Flavius, are alike. If Romulus truly had been taken up into the heavens, it would be strange for anything of this kind to be left behind. A miracle lifts up everything—bodies, garments, perhaps even souls.”

Slowly turning the purple fragment in his hands, Crispus smiled slightly. “Roman cloth,” he said, “royal purple, like the sort Romulus wore. Yet here it is, as if torn violently from the garment.”

At his words, I was unsettled. Crispus’s observations increased my own doubts; the very prodigy that the people were already celebrating he had now keenly questioned.

## Chapter III: Senator Valerius

After Crispus had reached his investigation in Campus Martius, a plan quickly formed in his mind. “Flavi,” he said, “it seems reasonable to speak with Valerius, the senator. His testimony about Romulus’s ascension could aid us in this inquiry. Some sense must be gleaned from this.”

So we set out for Valerius’s house. The place was beautiful, adorned with statues and ornaments that illustrated the glory of the Roman people. When we entered, Valerius, an elderly and serious man, welcomed us with a kindly spirit. “Greetings, friends! What brings you to me?”

Crispus, with a serene face, replied, “Senator, having heard about Romulus’s ascension, we cannot help but seek the truth. Many rumors circulate about this matter. Will you speak to us about it?”

Valerius, with shining golden eyes, smiled and said, “What troubles you, Crispus? All these are mere rumors, but the truth is eternal. Romulus, a god himself, ascended to the stars, so that eternal favor might be granted to the Roman people. You should not dwell in doubts.”

“But senator,” Crispus interjected, gently probing, “can you not say why no one saw him ascend? Such events are often witnessed by many, yet we have no witness, except your word alone.”

Valerius, tilting his face slightly, replied, “Crispus, not every truth must be known. This is a divine mystery. All things are provided for, and our Romulus, now in heaven, watches over us and grants us protection.”

I, hearing these words, felt my spirit growing in peace and faith in the senator. “Crispus,” I said, “Valerius is great and full of wisdom. His words seem to represent the truth. Why do you have these doubts?”

Crispus, sitting with an attentive face, clearly felt Valerius’s arguments were becoming less sound. “But to me,” he said, “most diligently, what is seen does not yield testimony, even though he has ascended to heaven. Your people ought to question this and not believe in mysteries that lie hidden in darkness.”

Valerius, with a stern look, insisted, “Crispus, you must not linger in ambiguity. The ascension of Romulus is a divine matter, and those who speak against it are enveloped in envy and curses from adversaries.”

After we left Valerius, Crispus raised his face, turned to me, and, softly murmuring, said, “Flavi, something here does not fit. Valerius presents his speech as truth, but his reasons do not withstand investigation.”

“What do you mean, Crispus?” I asked, somewhat confused. “Valerius is a great man, and his words seem to hold the truth.”

“It is not the truth that is presented,” Crispus replied. “All who seek the truth in heaven risk danger, and the eyes of the senate, it seems, do not care; they bring forth no truth at all. Perhaps his words are uncertain, and the matters prepared for us come from the other side. Much lies hidden in darkness.”

“What then is to be done?” I asked, anxious.

“I have decided,” Crispus said, “to seek other witnesses. Perhaps someone else has heard about this and will reveal the truth.”

“And I will follow you,” I said, placing my trust in Crispus.

“Very well,” Crispus replied, “together we will bring the truth into the light.”

## Chapter IV: The Veteran's Testimony

As Crispus left the house of Valerius, he directed his thoughts toward other matters. Walking in the Campus Martius, he scanned the area, hoping to find other witnesses. He noticed an old soldier sitting under the trees where soldiers had once gathered, his hair gray and his body showing the signs of many battles.

“Greetings, soldier,” Crispus said, approaching him. “I heard about the storm that recently occurred in this place. Will you tell me what you saw?”

The soldier, his eyes filled with memory, murmured, “Indeed, young man. This storm was terrible. I did not see everything, but I heard the sounds of battle and cries as dark clouds gathered above us.”

Crispus, gathering his thoughts, replied, “Did you hear battles? What do you think happened?”

“Surely,” the soldier responded. “From my experience in battles, when the wind stirs violently and the thunder resounds in the garden, fights often break out. I would rather believe that this was the case than a natural event. Something violent occurred here.”

“The storm was indeed terrible,” Crispus said, contemplating. “But did you never see men fighting?”

“Not directly,” the soldier replied, “but amidst the turmoil, there were sounds and shouts of battle. I, an old man, do not err; something happened in the darkness.”

Crispus, reflecting on his words, turned to me. “Flavius, what the soldier says is not without truth. The storm seems more about battle and conflict than about nature itself.”

“Indeed,” I said. “But what can you, Crispus, gather from these things?”

“There are many signs that have not been heard, and the soldier has only revealed this suspicion. The storm is not only natural; something greater is hidden here. We must continue to inquire,” Crispus replied, and soon thought of the purple cloth he had found in the Campus Martius.

“Remember,” he said, “that purple garment we discovered near the site of the ascension. That garment is not simple; perhaps it is a clue to the truth.”

The soldier, leaning in, asked, “What garment? Could it be a sign? It is certain that something lies hidden in the darkness.”

Crispus, resolute, replied, “Yes, if this garment relates to this matter, we must investigate what it might signify. I will not cease until the truth is revealed.”

“Beware, young man,” the soldier warned. “The storm often conceals the truth, and dangers lurk in the shadows. Be cautious.”

Crispus, connecting his thoughts to the garment, responded, “Let us proceed to the purple cloth, and perhaps the truth will reveal itself.”

## Chapter V: The Purple Cloth

Crispus, gazing intently at the fragment of purple cloth, slowly furrowed his brow. “This was certainly part of Romulus’s garment,” he said gravely, “but the question now is: how did it end up in this place?” Looking around as if piecing something together, he added, “Fabricius, a wise and distinguished senator, is often skilled at unraveling delicate political matters. It wouldn’t be surprising if he had learned something about these events, even about this so-called miracle. Shouldn’t we question him?”

“But Fabricius, like many senators, seems to believe in the miracle itself,” I replied. “Why should we meet with him, unless we mean to question his faith in it?”

Crispus smiled. “I’m not entirely convinced about the truth of these miracles, Flavius. Fabricius, either by scrutinizing rumors or other evidence, may know something about what happened from other citizens. Let’s go to his house; perhaps this piece of purple cloth ended up there as well.”

Fabricius was a keen and serious man who had long held important senatorial offices. He was rumored to have often shared secret plans with Romulus, and some suspected he had an influential, hidden hand in political affairs. So, we made our way to Fabricius’s house.

Upon our arrival, Crispus sought out a servant and, with careful questioning, began speaking to him—indirectly, so as not to arouse suspicion. He asked him about the day of the storm and the tumult that had occurred, then probed further, attempting to determine if anything hidden might lie within the house.

At first, the servant was evasive, but eventually, something Crispus said seemed to touch a nerve. “As you say, sir,” said the servant, hesitating slightly, “there are... matters that remain concealed. Fabricius often receives guests here, but only at certain hours, and always in silence and secrecy. What happens inside, no one knows—except Fabricius himself.”

Crispus, his expression indicating he had learned enough, turned to me and murmured, “Much in this house remains hidden, things the servant himself may not even know, yet he has told me enough... I deduce something remarkable, Flavius. I suspect a hidden place—a crypt, perhaps—where Romulus concealed himself, or perhaps lies hidden still.”

“A crypt?” I exclaimed, astonished. “How could you have understood this from the servant’s vague words?”

Crispus smiled and said, “Elementary, my dear Flavius. The servant admitted, albeit reluctantly, that Fabricius often receives guests in secrecy and in a specific location, without any noise. Such meetings aren’t held in publicly known places. Therefore, I conclude that a hidden location must exist.”

“But what shall we do? Can we find this crypt?” I asked, still incredulous.

“Of course,” Crispus replied, his eyes gleaming. “The servant said enough for me to believe a crypt is concealed within the inner parts of this house. Tomorrow, if fate favors us, we shall continue our investigation.”

## Chapter VI: The Hidden Crypt

In the dark night, as the moon cast a faint glow over the rooftops of the city, Crispus and I made our way back to Fabricius’s house. Only the murmurs of Rome’s night air reached us; all was wrapped in a deathly silence. Crispus, with sharp eyes and a keen mind, examined the exterior of the house carefully until he again inspected a hidden spot.

"Flavius," Crispus whispered, "this part of the wall does not quite match the rest. Look here, on the side, where the texture of the stones differs, as if part of the wall were hastily constructed to conceal something behind it."

Stepping closer, I noticed a fine, nearly invisible crack running along the wall. Crispus, exploring with his hand, pressed lightly against a particular stone, and we heard a faint sound of hidden mechanisms. Something shifted behind the wall.

"Look," Crispus said with a smile. "A most hidden door."

As the wall slowly swung open, it revealed a staircase descending into darkness below. We lit our lamps, casting a flickering glow into the depths. Crispus led the way, and I followed, my heart pounding with both excitement and fear. Slowly, we descended into the crypt hidden beneath Fabricius’s house.

Below, the air was cold and unmoving, as though it held all the shadows of the city above. The walls of the crypt were adorned with symbols of ancient gods, mysterious and arcane figures. Crispus remarked that Romulus himself had likely been drawn to such mysteries; indeed, this place seemed to have existed since the very beginnings of Rome, a silent monument.

At last, as the light from our lamps guided our steps, we came to another opening, where an archway of stone led to a small, concealed doorway. Dried bloodstains were visible on the steps, and a piece of purple cloth, like the one found earlier, clung to the threshold. Crispus gave a quick nod, signaling that we had found it.

"Onward, Flavius," he said in a hushed voice, “in the middle of the night, we approach the very truth.”

We crossed through the narrow doorway and entered a small, secret chamber. Crispus barely breathed as we beheld the figure of Romulus. He lay there, draped in a purple robe, his eyes closed, yet with a strangely serene expression, as if he were sunk in a profound sleep. His head was reclined, his hands folded, lying in a manner that suggested he was at rest, as if in final peace.

What we saw was both sacred and terrible. I, almost overwhelmed, could scarcely speak. "Could he be… dead?”

“Dead,” confirmed Crispus, his eyes fixed on the corpse. “Not taken by divine power, but by human hands… it seems, for some greater purpose.”

A heavy silence filled our investigation. Then Crispus, slowly and reverently, bent down, touching the cloak of Romulus, as if silently consenting to a truth he had grasped.

“This place,” he said, “is more of a testament than a grave. Some have acted to ensure that history remains veiled in mystery. For the safety of the Roman people, the truth shall remain here, buried.”

## Chapter VII: The Final Truth

Early the next morning, with the first light of dawn, Crispus and I returned to Fabricius’s house. This time, Crispus looked resolute and determined; something in his mind drove him on, as if he was convinced we were already near the truth. We found Fabricius seated in the atrium, his expression calm but betraying a hint of anxiety he could barely hide.

“Fabricius,” Crispus began in a cool tone, “we have come to learn the truth. Romulus… is dead. He lies hidden in the crypt beneath your house. Why do you insist on concealing the truth?”

Fabricius’s face changed slightly, his eyes fixed intently on Crispus. "What are you saying, Crispus?" he replied coldly, but suddenly a flicker of fear crossed his face. "Who led you to the crypt? This is… impossible. There was no crime."

Crispus had not yet responded when suddenly we heard a faint sound from the garden. Out of the shadows, a figure emerged—it was Valerius, pale but steadfast, who had been hiding in the darkness of the garden. He stepped toward us and gave Fabricius a nod of appeal. “The truth, Fabricius, must come to light at some point,” he said gravely. “Crispus already knows much. Nor do I believe he is the sort of man to deceive his fellow citizens.”

Crispus and I watched Valerius in silence, and after a long pause, he revealed his heart to us.

“Crispus,” Valerius said, “Romulus, while ruling our nation under the guise of a benevolent king, was amassing too much power for himself. Laws, policies, even the treasury he considered his own; our decrees were ignored, and the state—Rome itself—was coming under the feet of a single man. Who would defend our liberty, if not us?”

Fabricius lowered his gaze, nodding slightly in affirmation, supporting Valerius’s words. “Romulus was not a king; he was bound to become a tyrant. If we had not removed him, he would have corrupted the republic—and all of Rome—beneath him.”

Crispus stood silently for a moment, weighing what he had heard. Finally, turning to Valerius with a grave expression, he asked, “And the people? Do you realize how this truth would disturb them?”

“Some must know, Crispus,” Valerius replied slowly, “but not the people. They want to believe in a divine fate.”

Crispus then turned to me, his face calm but intent. Timidly, I asked him, “So, what are we to do? Reveal it or hide it?”

Then Crispus solemnly replied, “This place—this house—shall be Romulus’s monument, as well as to what befell him. The truth of this affair, Flavius, would endanger everyone, serving only to spread unrest. For the city’s safety, we must preserve that silence forever.”
