# The Final Mystery of Romulus

## Chapter I: Rumor and Doubt

In the thirty-seventh year after the founding of the city, a wondrous rumor spread through all of Rome like wildfire: Romulus, founder and king of the city, had been taken by the god Mars, ascending into the heavens! The people, from the commoners to the senators, received this news in the streets and forums, some cheering in exultation, others shedding tears in reverence. The Senate itself confirmed this story with official declarations, asserting that Romulus had now become a god and would forever watch over his city.

I, Gaius Flavius, was recounting these events to my friend Marcus Terentius Crispus when I noticed a faint hint of doubt on his face. “Crispus,” I said, “does this not seem marvelous to you? I can imagine it now: Romulus, lifted through a break in the clouds, surrounded by flashes of light; the people prostrate on the ground, averting their eyes from the divine radiance. And since Marcellus himself, the tribune, claimed to have seen the cloud rise to the heavens, who could doubt it?”

Crispus, however, raised his gaze and fixed his perceptive eyes on me. In a low voice, he replied, “Flavius, the story is indeed remarkable, but why has it spread so quickly throughout the city? Nothing on its own could take root in public opinion so swiftly or with such unshakable confidence. Yet here we are, with all of Rome united in belief, as though no one could conceive of it being anything but the truth.”

Somewhat uncertain, I replied, “But surely this is a sign of divinity, Crispus—that with no delay, no hesitation, this vision is set firmly in the people’s minds.” Yet I noticed him watching me more closely, a faint, ironic smile barely concealed.

“Flavius,” he said, “Rome is inclined to believe rumors, but a sudden ascension like this, of their own king, would never have been so quickly accepted without some delay, unless the Senate itself had urged the people toward faith in it. There is no proof at all except the senators’ words. And none but those nearest to him in the Senate even saw this ‘ascension.’”

Crispus’s words made me uneasy; it was true, now that I considered it, that the Senate had proclaimed this story to the people so swiftly, so immediately, and so unanimously, almost as if to extinguish any questions in the minds of the people. Yet Crispus still smiled faintly, as though more were left unsaid.

After a brief silence, Crispus added, in a slightly more serious tone, “This, Flavius, which has been impressed so firmly upon the people, sounds to me less like the intervention of Mars and more like the craft of the Senate. If we seek not what is spoken but what is concealed, we may be led to the hidden truth.”

## Chapter II: The Beginning of the Investigation

Afterward, as dawn broke with the arrival of a new day, Crispus and I, now filled with suspicion and concern, set out to Campus Martius. This place, vast and beautiful, was full of history and glorious deeds. Here, once, the Roman army would gather for games and celebrations, and in its midst, the temples of the gods would rise prominently. The shade of the trees and the sweet fragrance of the air now stirred doubt and anxiety in our hearts.

We arrived at the spot where Romulus, according to the rumor, ascended to the heavens. The ground was covered with grasses and flowers, but there were neither clouds nor heavenly portals visible that would indicate his ascension. Nothing was apparent there, only the beauty of nature, which both attracted and troubled our minds.

Crispus, with a serene expression and keen eyes, leaned down to examine the ground, scrutinizing the tracks and traces in the earth. “If this happened here, Flavi,” he said, “perhaps the traces of some person or certain signs will reveal themselves to us.” I saw his gaze fixed on the ground, and I was prepared for a long observation.

The area was surrounded by large trees, and the wind softly rustled among the leafy branches. Crispus studied the remnants of the place as he perceived some scattered leaves and grasses. Soon, leaning closer to the ground, his eye was caught by something unusual. Among the grasses and leaves appeared a piece of beautiful purple cloth, discarded on the ground. “Look here, Flavi!” he exclaimed. “Something is being concealed from us. See what this is!”

Crispus followed the trace, and nearby in a small hollow, visible signs of a struggle appeared: a broken branch, trampled grasses, and disturbed earth. “Surely something serious happened here,” Crispus said, his expression reflecting suspicion.

As hidden shadows lurked between the bushes, Crispus began to question passersby who were coming to the games and festivities. Among them was a youth named Marcus, the son of a farmer, who approached us and said, “I have indeed heard about the ascension of Romulus, but it was merely an empty clamor and joy. I stood in the crowd, yet saw nothing except people shouting.”

Crispus, upon hearing this, raised his eyes, and thoughts quickly revolved in his mind. “The youth says,” he remarked, “that this could only be a rumor shouted forth, as there was no witness. Perhaps something in the ground leads us away from this tale.” He questioned the young man about nearby places, and by the end of the conversation, he directed him to the water that flowed through Campus Martius.

There, on the riverbank, Crispus began to examine carefully. The traces, numerous from the grass and bare earth, revealed another matter. “There,” he said, “you can see. Not only the traces but also signs that seemed to weep upon the earth. Perhaps something was left behind here.”

Crispus then moved through other paths and came to an open view where other spectators who had dined were gathering to celebrate. There, he heard from an old man named Lucius, who had spent his entire life in Campus Martius, and approaching him, Crispus asked, “What do you know about the ascension of Romulus? Did you see this happen?”

Lucius, with a very sad expression, replied, “I was not part of it, but I hear many things. Those who are together with the Senate keep this truth hidden in darkness.”

When Crispus heard this, his spirit became more resolute. He placed diligence and thought into his investigation. All these signs indicated that something obscure was being concealed; while some traces seemed to lead us, the truth itself remained hidden, dark and inaccessible.

After much inquiry, Crispus sat beneath the shade of a tree and, contemplating in his mind, considered what was just. “Flavi,” he said, “this brings not only an incredible tale; rather, wisdom yields a better release. The truth seems to hide here, and I shall watch over it, perhaps in vain.”

## Chapter III: Valerius and the Truth

After Crispus had reached his investigation in Campus Martius, a plan quickly formed in his mind. “Flavi,” he said, “it seems reasonable to speak with Valerius, the senator. His testimony about Romulus’s ascension could aid us in this inquiry. Some sense must be gleaned from this.”

So we set out for Valerius’s house. The place was beautiful, adorned with statues and ornaments that illustrated the glory of the Roman people. When we entered, Valerius, an elderly and serious man, welcomed us with a kindly spirit. “Greetings, friends! What brings you to me?”

Crispus, with a serene face, replied, “Senator, having heard about Romulus’s ascension, we cannot help but seek the truth. Many rumors circulate about this matter. Will you speak to us about it?”

Valerius, with shining golden eyes, smiled and said, “What troubles you, Crispus? All these are mere rumors, but the truth is eternal. Romulus, a god himself, ascended to the stars, so that eternal favor might be granted to the Roman people. You should not dwell in doubts.”

“But senator,” Crispus interjected, gently probing, “can you not say why no one saw him ascend? Such events are often witnessed by many, yet we have no witness, except your word alone.”

Valerius, tilting his face slightly, replied, “Crispus, not every truth must be known. This is a divine mystery. All things are provided for, and our Romulus, now in heaven, watches over us and grants us protection.”

I, hearing these words, felt my spirit growing in peace and faith in the senator. “Crispus,” I said, “Valerius is great and full of wisdom. His words seem to represent the truth. Why do you have these doubts?”

Crispus, sitting with an attentive face, clearly felt Valerius’s arguments were becoming less sound. “But to me,” he said, “most diligently, what is seen does not yield testimony, even though he has ascended to heaven. Your people ought to question this and not believe in mysteries that lie hidden in darkness.”

Valerius, with a stern look, insisted, “Crispus, you must not linger in ambiguity. The ascension of Romulus is a divine matter, and those who speak against it are enveloped in envy and curses from adversaries.”

After we left Valerius, Crispus raised his face, turned to me, and, softly murmuring, said, “Flavi, something here does not fit. Valerius presents his speech as truth, but his reasons do not withstand investigation.”

“What do you mean, Crispus?” I asked, somewhat confused. “Valerius is a great man, and his words seem to hold the truth.”

“It is not the truth that is presented,” Crispus replied. “All who seek the truth in heaven risk danger, and the eyes of the senate, it seems, do not care; they bring forth no truth at all. Perhaps his words are uncertain, and the matters prepared for us come from the other side. Much lies hidden in darkness.”

“What then is to be done?” I asked, anxious.

“I have decided,” Crispus said, “to seek other witnesses. Perhaps someone else has heard about this and will reveal the truth.”

“And I will follow you,” I said, placing my trust in Crispus.

“Very well,” Crispus replied, “together we will bring the truth into the light.”

## Chapter IV: The Old Soldier and the Storm

As Crispus left the house of Valerius, he directed his thoughts toward other matters. Walking in the Campus Martius, he scanned the area, hoping to find other witnesses. He noticed an old soldier sitting under the trees where soldiers had once gathered, his hair gray and his body showing the signs of many battles.

“Greetings, soldier,” Crispus said, approaching him. “I heard about the storm that recently occurred in this place. Will you tell me what you saw?”

The soldier, his eyes filled with memory, murmured, “Indeed, young man. This storm was terrible. I did not see everything, but I heard the sounds of battle and cries as dark clouds gathered above us.”

Crispus, gathering his thoughts, replied, “Did you hear battles? What do you think happened?”

“Surely,” the soldier responded. “From my experience in battles, when the wind stirs violently and the thunder resounds in the garden, fights often break out. I would rather believe that this was the case than a natural event. Something violent occurred here.”

“But what did you see?” Crispus interjected, trying to learn more.

“Not much,” the soldier admitted. “But I saw flashes of lightning, and everything was greatly disturbed. The people were fleeing in chaos, and I lay alone, seeking refuge. I could see the lightning, and when one struck, I heard a horrible noise. Whatever happened could not be without conflict.”

“The storm was indeed terrible,” Crispus said, contemplating. “But did you never see men fighting?”

“Not directly,” the soldier replied, “but amidst the turmoil, there were sounds and shouts of battle. I, an old man, do not err; something happened in the darkness.”

Crispus, reflecting on his words, turned to me. “Flavius, what the soldier says is not without truth. The storm seems more about battle and conflict than about nature itself.”

“Indeed,” I said. “But what can you, Crispus, gather from these things?”

“There are many signs that have not been heard, and the soldier has only revealed this suspicion. The storm is not only natural; something greater is hidden here. We must continue to inquire,” Crispus replied, and soon thought of the purple cloth he had found in the Campus Martius.

“Remember,” he said, “that purple garment we discovered near the site of the ascension. That garment is not simple; perhaps it is a clue to the truth.”

The soldier, leaning in, asked, “What garment? Could it be a sign? It is certain that something lies hidden in the darkness.”

Crispus, resolute, replied, “Yes, if this garment relates to this matter, we must investigate what it might signify. I will not cease until the truth is revealed.”

“Beware, young man,” the soldier warned. “The storm often conceals the truth, and dangers lurk in the shadows. Be cautious.”

Crispus, connecting his thoughts to the garment, responded, “Let us proceed to the purple cloth, and perhaps the truth will reveal itself.”

## Chapter V: Hidden Traces

Crispus, holding the purple cloth in his hand and gazing intently at it, murmured, “I believe this cloth is a clue. It didn’t simply fall here in the Campus Martius by accident; it’s a garment of dignity, one that could only be found in a senator’s household.”

“What are you thinking, then?” I asked, a bit unsettled.

“Something significant. Perhaps this cloth was torn from the robe of some senator. Fabricius, a shrewd senator and confidant of Romulus, might provide us with valuable information. Let’s go.”

Fabricius was a keen and serious man who had long held important senatorial offices. He was rumored to have often shared secret plans with Romulus, and some suspected he had an influential, hidden hand in political affairs. So, we made our way to Fabricius’s house.

Upon our arrival, Crispus sought out a servant and, with careful questioning, began speaking to him—indirectly, so as not to arouse suspicion. He asked him about the day of the storm and the tumult that had occurred, then probed further, attempting to determine if anything hidden might lie within the house.

At first, the servant was evasive, but eventually, something Crispus said seemed to touch a nerve. “As you say, sir,” said the servant, hesitating slightly, “there are... matters that remain concealed. Fabricius often receives guests here, but only at certain hours, and always in silence and secrecy. What happens inside, no one knows—except Fabricius himself.”

Crispus, his expression indicating he had learned enough, turned to me and murmured, “Much in this house remains hidden, things the servant himself may not even know, yet he has told me enough... I deduce something remarkable, Flavius. I suspect a hidden place—a crypt, perhaps—where Romulus concealed himself, or perhaps lies hidden still.”

“A crypt?” I exclaimed, astonished. “How could you have understood this from the servant’s vague words?”

Crispus smiled and said, “It’s quite simple. The servant admitted, albeit reluctantly, that Fabricius often receives guests in secrecy and in a specific location, without any noise. Such meetings aren’t held in publicly known places. Therefore, I conclude that a hidden location must exist.”

“But what shall we do? Can we find this crypt?” I asked, still incredulous.

“Of course,” Crispus replied, his eyes gleaming. “The servant said enough for me to believe a crypt is concealed within the inner parts of this house. Tomorrow, if fate favors us, we shall continue our investigation.”
