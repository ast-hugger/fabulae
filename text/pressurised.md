# The Adventure of the Pressurised Thought

*by Horace V. Pennington*

## CHAPTER I

*In Which We Encounter a Singular Club, a Celebrated Detective, and the Promise of Pressurised Thought*

The Chloratic Society Club stands at the quieter end of Pall Mall—that is to say, the end where gentlemen go when they have exhausted the possibilities of the noisier establishments and wish to doze in peace. It is a tall, soot-dusted structure, squeezed somewhat apologetically between Dobbins & Carfax's piano warehouse and the offices of the *Bimetallic Review*—a publication which concerns itself with questions of currency and is read by precisely eleven subscribers, all of whom write angry letters to the editor denouncing the other ten. A casual passer-by might mistake the Club for any other London edifice where elderly clerks perpetually adjust ledgers. Only the faint glimmer of green glass in the vestibule lamps hints at its particular character.

Inside, the Club reveals itself as a narrow and lamplit kingdom of respectable oddities. The entrance hall smells faintly of Russia leather and pipe ash, as though the carpets have absorbed a century's worth of Victorian anxieties. A member entering at dusk—preferably with the collar of his greatcoat turned up—receives from the porter a bow of such geological slowness that it suggests the movement of sedimentary strata rather than a human neck. The porter has been perfecting this bow for thirty-seven years and gives no indication that the enterprise will ever reach its conclusion.

The members pride themselves on being men of chloratic temperament—a phrase which, while scientifically meaningless, carries an air of intellectual exclusivity that satisfies everyone concerned. In practical terms, this means they are both mildly pale of complexion and devoted to the pursuit of knowledge that sensible men leave well alone. Failing both criteria, a prospective member may still qualify if he can at least be relied upon to keep quiet in the reading room.

The said reading room, with its green-shaded lamps and deep, amphibian hush, contains newspapers from every continental capital, many of which remain unread for weeks on end except by one elderly barrister who has privately vowed to outlive the Ottoman Empire and checks its obituary daily. The smoking room is a perpetual fogbank of Latakia and earnest, muddled talk about municipal drainage. The Club's Green Salon, a smaller chamber overlooking a courtyard of captive plane trees, is reserved for the discussion of scientific matters, although the science tends to be of a speculative sort—Martian canals, anti-gravity notions, and peculiar machines that a member is quite certain will revolutionise omnibus propulsion, if only the authorities would take him seriously.

It was into this world that, on the fog-bound evening our narrative properly commences, a most unusual visitor was about to arrive.

I should, perhaps, introduce myself. My name is Horace Pennington, and I am a member of the Chloratic Society in good standing, which is to say I paid my fees promptly and harbour no strong opinions about drainage. I had joined the Club some years earlier on the recommendation of an uncle who believed it would improve my character, though in what direction he never specified. I am a man of modest independent means, no particular profession, and a constitutional tendency toward observation rather than participation—qualities which, as it happened, suited me admirably for the role fate was about to thrust upon me.

On the evening in question, I had installed myself in the Green Salon with a glass of tolerably decent claret and was listening with half an ear to a dispute concerning the feasibility of communication with the dead by means of galvanic apparatus, when our Chairman entered the room in a state of considerable agitation.

Sir Bartholomew Cripps-Morden was not a man built for agitation. He was built, rather, for sitting in leather armchairs and making pronouncements—a large, florid gentleman of perhaps sixty years, with magnificent white whiskers that spread across his face like the wings of some elderly and self-satisfied bird. He had made his fortune in something to do with India, the precise nature of which no one could quite recall, and had ascended to the Chairmanship of the Chloratic Society through the twin virtues of availability and the willingness to pay for the annual dinner. In all my years at the Club, I had never seen him move faster than a dignified amble. Yet here he was, practically bustling, his whiskers aquiver with purpose.

'Gentlemen,' he announced, 'our guest has arrived. I must ask you to comport yourselves with appropriate gravity. We are about to receive Mr. Sherlock Holmes.'

The effect of this announcement was immediate and electric. Conversations ceased. Glasses paused halfway to lips. Even the elderly barrister, who had been muttering about the Sublime Porte, looked up from his newspaper with an expression suggesting that the Ottoman Empire might, for once, have to wait.

I confess I felt a certain thrill myself. The name of Sherlock Holmes was, by this time, known to every literate person in England—the famous consulting detective of Baker Street, whose exploits had been chronicled in the popular press with a frequency that suggested tireless dedication to either justice or publicity. I had read several of these accounts and found them entertaining, if somewhat improbable. Now, it seemed, I was to meet the man himself.

He entered the Green Salon a moment later, and I understood at once why the accounts had devoted such attention to his appearance. Holmes was tall—remarkably so—and thin in the manner of a man who forgets to eat when occupied by more interesting matters. His face was sharp and angular, dominated by a hawkish nose and a pair of grey eyes that swept the room with an intensity suggesting that he was not merely looking at us but cataloguing us, filing away observations for future reference. He wore a dark frock coat of excellent cut and carried himself with the coiled alertness of a predator at rest. One felt, instinctively, that very little escaped his notice, and that what did escape his notice was probably not worth noticing in the first place.

'Mr. Holmes,' said Sir Bartholomew, performing introductions with the gravity of a museum curator displaying a prized artefact, 'welcome to the Chloratic Society. I trust your journey was not too disagreeable?'

'The fog,' said Holmes, in a voice both precise and faintly sardonic, 'was instructive. I observed no fewer than three distinct varieties between Baker Street and Pall Mall, each suggesting a different combination of coal smoke and river vapour. London's atmosphere is a text, Sir Bartholomew, for those who care to read it.' He surveyed the assembled members with what might have been amusement. 'But I understand you have invited me here to evaluate a rather different sort of text. A reasoning machine, I believe you called it?'

'Indeed, indeed!' Sir Bartholomew's whiskers performed a small dance of enthusiasm. 'The invention of our own Professor Thripp. A most remarkable apparatus. Most remarkable. He claims it can perform feats of logical deduction entirely without human intervention. Naturally, when considering who might evaluate such a device, your name suggested itself immediately. Who better to judge a reasoning machine than the foremost reasoner in England?'

Holmes's thin lips curved into something that was not quite a smile. 'You flatter me, Sir Bartholomew. Or perhaps you flatter the machine. We shall see which proves more deserving.'

As if summoned by the mention of his name—though more likely he had simply lost track of time and wandered in by accident—Professor Osmond Thripp appeared in the doorway. He was a small, round man of indeterminate age, with hair that appeared to have been styled by galvanic discharge and spectacles so thick they gave his eyes a perpetually startled quality, as though he had just witnessed something astonishing and had not yet recovered. His waistcoat was buttoned incorrectly. His cravat had achieved independence from his collar and was making a break for freedom down his chest. In one hand he clutched a sheaf of papers covered in calculations; in the other, inexplicably, a half-eaten sandwich.

Behind him, almost invisible in the Professor's considerable shadow despite Thripp's modest stature, hovered a young man of such profound ordinariness that the eye slid off him like water from oiled canvas. This was Mr. Edwin Marsh, Thripp's assistant—a person of medium height, medium colouring, and medium demeanour, possessed of the sort of face one forgets while still looking at it. He carried a leather satchel and wore an expression of patient resignation, as though long accustomed to trailing in his employer's wake and catching whatever the Professor might drop, whether sandwich crumbs or brilliant insights.

'Ah!' the Professor said, blinking at the assembly. 'Are we beginning? I thought we were beginning tomorrow. Or was it yesterday? The days do blur so when one is calibrating the tertiary inference cylinders.' He noticed Holmes and brightened considerably. 'You must be the detective! Excellent, excellent. You will appreciate the machine, I think. It reasons, you see. *Reasons*. From premises to conclusions, entirely through mechanical action. Steam, Mr. Holmes—steam is the secret. Pressurised thought, one might call it. The logical impulses travel through a network of tubes and manifolds, you see, hundreds of them, each calibrated to carry a particular category of inference. The steam enters at the premise valves, passes through the deductive chambers, and emerges at the conclusion registers as pure, irrefutable logic. No intuition, no guesswork, no—' he waved the sandwich vaguely—'no human muddle. Pure reason, rendered in brass and copper and live steam.'

'A bold claim,' said Holmes, and I detected in his voice a note of genuine interest beneath the habitual irony. 'I confess I am curious to see how brass and stream and—what was it?—inference cylinders propose to accomplish what is so difficult for most human beings.'

'In an hour!' declared Professor Thripp. 'The demonstration begins in an hour. I must return to my preparations. The secondary axiom wheels require adjustment, the boiler must be brought to precisely the correct pressure, and I believe one of the inferential manifolds has developed a slight leak—nothing serious, merely a wisp of escaped reasoning, but it must be attended to.' He turned and shuffled toward the door, then paused and looked back with an expression of sudden anxiety. 'It *is* in an hour, isn't it? Not tomorrow?'

'In an hour,' Sir Bartholomew confirmed, with the patience of long practice.

'In an hour,' repeated Thripp, satisfied. 'Excellent. In an hour we shall witness the dawn of mechanical reason.' And with that, he departed, trailing sandwich crumbs and the faint air of genius operating at a frequency the rest of us could not quite perceive.

Holmes watched him go with an expression I could not decipher. 'A reasoning machine,' he murmured, half to himself. 'How very interesting. How very interesting indeed.'

I could not have known it then, but those words marked the beginning of an adventure that would shake the Chloratic Society to its foundations—and perhaps a good deal more besides.

## CHAPTER II

*In Which Professor Thripp's Apparatus is Unveiled, and Mr. Holmes Makes A Pointed Enquiry*

In an hour we entered the Green Salon and found it transformed. The comfortable leather armchairs had been pushed back against the walls, the carpet rolled up and removed, and in the centre of the room, occupying a space roughly equivalent to a small hippopotamus, stood Professor Thripp's reasoning machine.

I confess that my first impression was one of profound bewilderment. The device defied easy description, being composed of so many disparate elements that the eye scarcely knew where to settle. At its base sat a coal-fired boiler of the sort one might find in a modest textile mill, from which rose a positive forest of copper pipes, brass tubes, and glass cylinders, all intertwining with one another in patterns that suggested either extraordinary genius or complete lunacy. Steam hissed gently from various joints, lending the apparatus an air of barely contained impatience, as though it were a living creature straining at an invisible leash.

The upper portion of the machine was dominated by what I can only describe as a vast honeycomb of small brass chambers, hundreds upon hundreds of them, each connected to its neighbours by an intricate web of narrow tubes. These chambers glinted in the gaslight, and I noticed that each bore a tiny label—though from my vantage point I could not read what was written upon them. Behind this honeycomb arrangement stood a series of large wooden boxes, each perhaps three feet tall and fitted with brass mechanisms that clicked and whirred with quiet industry. The purpose of these boxes escaped me entirely.

At the front of the machine, facing the assembled audience like the face of some mechanical oracle, was a panel of brass dials, gauges, and indicators. At the bottom, a mechanical arm stood poised above a roll of blank paper, ready to inscribe the machine's pronouncements.

'Magnificent, is it not?' said Sir Bartholomew, appearing at my elbow with the pride of a man who has not the slightest idea what he is looking at but is confident it must be impressive.

The members of the Chloratic Society had turned out in considerable numbers for the demonstration. I counted perhaps thirty gentlemen arranged in a semicircle before the machine, their faces displaying varying degrees of anticipation, scepticism, and—in the case of one elderly member who had clearly wandered in from the smoking room—complete incomprehension. Holmes stood apart from the group, closer to the machine than anyone else, his grey eyes moving systematically over its surface with the intensity of a man reading a particularly dense legal document.

Professor Thripp himself fluttered about the apparatus like an anxious parent preparing a child for examination. He checked gauges, adjusted valves, and muttered calculations under his breath. His waistcoat, I noticed, was buttoned correctly this evening—a sure sign that he considered the occasion one of unusual importance. The sandwich had been replaced by a pocket watch, which he consulted every few seconds with mounting agitation. His assistant, the unremarkable Mr. Marsh, moved quietly about the machine's periphery, stoking the boiler and wiping condensation from brass fittings with a cloth, performing his duties with the mechanical efficiency of one who has long since ceased to find any of this extraordinary—or perhaps never found it extraordinary in the first place.

'The pressure is nominal,' Thripp announced to no one in particular. 'The knowledge boxes are properly loaded. The inference manifolds are clear.' He peered at a gauge and frowned. 'Though the tertiary inference chamber is running slightly warm. No matter, no matter. We shall proceed.'

Holmes, who had been conducting his silent examination of the machine, now spoke. 'Professor Thripp, I observe that your apparatus contains—if I have counted correctly—some seven hundred and forty-two individual chambers in that honeycomb arrangement. Each, I note, is connected to between six and twelve of its neighbours, with no two chambers sharing precisely the same pattern of connexions. The labels, which I can just make out, appear to be words—common English words, if I am not mistaken. "King." "River." "Murder." "Tuesday." And so forth.'

Thripp's eyes widened behind his spectacles. 'You have a remarkable eye, Mr. Holmes. Remarkable! Yes, each chamber represents what I call a "concept node." The words are merely labels for our convenience—the machine itself, of course, does not read them. What matters is the pattern of connexions between the nodes, and the varying resistance of the tubes that link them.'

'Varying resistance?' Holmes raised an eyebrow.

'Ah!' Thripp rubbed his hands together with evident delight. 'That is the heart of the mechanism. You see, Mr. Holmes, each tube connecting two concept nodes contains a series of small valves—I call them "association gates." When steam passes through the system, it flows more easily through some pathways than others, depending on how the gates are set. The configuration of these gates represents the machine's... knowledge, if you will. Its understanding of how concepts relate to one another.'

'And how are these gates configured?'

'That,' said Thripp, with the air of a conjuror about to reveal his greatest trick, 'requires me first to explain how queries are posed to the machine.' He scurried to the front of the apparatus and indicated the slot at the top of the control panel. 'Queries are encoded on cards of stiff paper using a system of punched holes. Each hole corresponds to a concept node. The pattern of holes activates the relevant nodes simultaneously, and the machine then propagates steam through the association network to generate a response. The response is decoded and inscribed on paper by the output arm.'

He held up a stack of cards, each one covered in a precise pattern of small round holes.

'Now, here is my most ingenious innovation.' Thripp gestured toward the large wooden boxes at the rear of the machine. 'I had the idea of using the same punch cards employed for queries as a means of storing knowledge itself. I call them "knowledge cards." Those boxes contain tens of thousands of them—the complete works of the *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, Bradshaw's railway timetables, three years of *The Times*, selected parliamentary debates, and Mrs. Beeton's *Book of Household Management*, all transcribed onto cards in my encoding system.'

A murmur of appreciation rippled through the assembled members. Holmes's expression remained carefully neutral.

'The machine consumes these cards as needed,' Thripp continued, warming to his subject. 'As queries pass through the system, the apparatus draws upon the knowledge cards to maintain the association gates at their optimal weights—strengthening pathways between concepts that frequently appear together, weakening those that do not. It is, in essence, a self-regulating system. The more the machine is used, the more refined its associations become.'

'Statistical patterns,' Holmes repeated, and I detected a note of something—interest? scepticism?—in his voice. 'You are saying, Professor, that your machine does not truly *understand* the concepts it manipulates. It merely knows which concepts tend to appear in proximity to which other concepts, based on the frequency of such co-occurrences in your learning material.'

Thripp blinked rapidly, as though Holmes had touched upon a matter of some delicacy. 'Well—that is—the question of what constitutes true understanding is rather philosophical in nature, Mr. Holmes. What I can tell you is that the machine produces *outputs* that are indistinguishable from understanding. When presented with a query, it activates the relevant concept nodes, allows steam to flow through the network of associations, and arrives at responses that are remarkably—one might even say uncannily—coherent.'

'Indistinguishable from understanding,' Holmes murmured. 'A fascinating formulation. And you have prepared demonstration queries, I take it?'

'Indeed I have.' Thripp held up the stack of cards once more. 'Shall we begin?'

'One moment,' said Holmes. 'Tell me, Professor—what happens if the query itself contains concepts that appeared rarely in your knowledge boxes? Concepts the machine has, so to speak, encountered only glancingly?'

Thripp's enthusiasm dimmed slightly. 'That is... a known limitation. When the machine is confronted with unfamiliar territory, its responses can become somewhat... unpredictable. The steam, lacking clear pathways, tends to find whatever routes are available, leading to outputs that may be grammatically correct but semantically... eccentric.'

'Eccentric,' Holmes repeated. 'A charitable description, I suspect. And what safeguards exist to prevent the machine from producing responses that are not merely eccentric but actively false? If your learning corpus contained errors—if *The Times* misreported a fact, or the *Encyclopaedia* contained an outdated entry—would the machine not reproduce those errors with perfect confidence?'

A somewhat uncomfortable silence fell over the Green Salon. Thripp adjusted his spectacles and cleared his throat.

'The machine,' he said carefully, 'produces responses that reflect the patterns present in its knowledge boxes. It has no independent means of verifying the accuracy of that material. This is, I grant you, a limitation. But consider, Mr. Holmes—is this not true of human beings as well? Do we not all reason from the information we have been given, with no absolute guarantee of its accuracy?'

Holmes smiled thinly. 'A philosophical point, Professor, and not without merit. But I note a crucial difference. When a human being encounters information that contradicts their existing knowledge or exceeds its boundaries, they experience what we might call cognitive dissonance—a discomfort that prompts them to investigate, to reconcile the contradiction, to seek truth. Does your machine experience any such discomfort when it produces nonsense?'

'It does not experience anything at all, Mr. Holmes. It is a machine.'

'Precisely,' said Holmes. 'And that, I suspect, is both its greatest strength and its most profound limitation. But I have delayed your demonstration long enough. Please, Professor—let us see what your engine of pressurised thought can accomplish.'

Thripp nodded, his expression suggesting that Holmes had raised questions he had spent many sleepless nights contemplating himself. He selected a card from his prepared stack and held it up for the audience to see.

'Our first query,' he announced, 'is a simple test of factual recall. I shall ask the machine: "What is the capital of France?"'

He inserted the card into the slot. Deep within the machine, something clicked and whirred. Steam hissed through a thousand tiny passages. The concept chambers flickered with subtle variations in pressure, their brass surfaces gleaming as though alive with thought. From the knowledge boxes came a rapid fluttering sound, as though countless cards were being shuffled and sorted by invisible hands. And after perhaps thirty seconds of this mechanical cogitation, the output arm descended to the paper and began to write.

The assembled gentlemen leaned forward as one.

The arm lifted. Thripp tore off the paper and read aloud, with evident satisfaction: '"The capital of France is Paris, a city of considerable beauty situated upon the River Seine."'

A burst of applause erupted from the members. Even the elderly gentleman from the smoking room clapped, though his expression suggested he was still not entirely certain what he was applauding.

Holmes did not applaud. He merely nodded, once, and said: 'An encouraging beginning, Professor. But I wonder—might I be permitted to pose a question of my own?'

Thripp hesitated, glancing at his prepared stack of cards with the expression of a man who has rehearsed a theatrical production and is now being asked to improvise. 'I suppose... that is to say... the encoding process is somewhat technical...'

'I shall dictate,' said Holmes, 'and you shall punch the cards.'

There was little Thripp could do but acquiesce. He retrieved a blank card and placed it into the punching device standing beside the machine, positioning himself like a secretary awaiting dictation.

'The query is as follows,' said Holmes, and I detected a glint of mischief in those sharp grey eyes. '"What are the notable achievements of the detective Mr. Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street?"'

A ripple of interest passed through the assembled members. This was rather more entertaining than questions about European capitals. Thripp's punch clicked rapidly as he encoded the query, his brow furrowed in concentration. When he had finished, he held up the card for Holmes's inspection.

'I believe that is correct, Mr. Holmes. Shall I proceed?'

'By all means.'

The card disappeared into the slot. Once again the machine stirred to life—the hissing of steam, the clicking of valves, the subtle dance of pressure through seven hundred and forty-two brass chambers. I fancied I could almost see the mechanical thoughts forming, concepts linking to concepts in chains of statistical association. *Detective* connecting to *crime* connecting to *London* connecting to *famous* connecting to *Holmes*...

The process took somewhat longer this time. The knowledge boxes clattered with furious activity. Steam escaped from a joint near the top of the apparatus with a sound rather like a thoughtful exhalation. At last, the output arm descended and began its inscription—and continued, and continued, covering rather more paper than the previous response had required.

Thripp tore off the completed output and scanned it, his expression shifting from anticipation to puzzlement to something approaching alarm. He cleared his throat.

'Perhaps,' he said, 'I should read this silently first, to ensure—'

'Nonsense,' said Holmes. 'Read it aloud, Professor. I am eager to learn of my own achievements. One so rarely has the opportunity for objective self-assessment.'

Thripp swallowed and began to read.

'"Mr. Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street is widely regarded as the foremost detective in the British Empire and possibly the world. Among his notable achievements are the following: First, the successful resolution of the scandal involving the King of Bohemia and a certain photograph, in which Holmes demonstrated his mastery of disguise and his understanding of human nature—"'

'That is substantially accurate,' Holmes allowed, with a faint nod.

'"Second, the solution of the brutal murders in the Rue Morgue in Paris, in which Holmes identified the killer as an escaped orangutan from a Maltese sailor's vessel, a deduction that baffled the Parisian police—"'

Holmes's eyebrows rose sharply. 'That case,' he said, 'was solved by C. Auguste Dupin, a French amateur of some considerable talent, nearly half a century before I was born. Your machine appears to have confused its detectives.'

'"Third, the prevention of the assassination of Queen Victoria by agents of the Domdaniel Conspiracy, in which Holmes, armed only with a magnifying glass and a trained falcon—"'

'I do not,' Holmes interjected mildly, 'own a falcon.'

'"—tracked the conspirators to St. Paul's Cathedral, defeated their leader Count Orsini in a sword fight atop the dome, and was subsequently knighted by the Prince of Wales in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace."'

Thripp lowered the paper. The Green Salon had fallen utterly silent.

'I have not been knighted,' said Holmes, in a tone of dry amusement. 'And I have never fought anyone atop St. Paul's—the vergers would object strenuously—and the Domdaniel Conspiracy is, I regret to say, an invention of your remarkable machine.' He paused, and something like a smile flickered across his angular features. 'Although I confess the trained falcon is a charming detail. I may consider acquiring one.'

Professor Thripp had gone quite pink. 'I must apologise, Mr. Holmes. The machine has clearly—that is to say—the learning corpus must have contained sensationalised accounts—journalists do so love to embellish—'

'You need not apologise, Professor.' Holmes's tone was surprisingly gentle. 'Your machine has done precisely what you designed it to do. It has identified the concepts relevant to the query—"Holmes," "detective," "achievement," "famous"—and it has traced the statistical pathways connecting those concepts to produce fluent, confident prose. The fact that the prose is on occasion entirely fictive is not a failure of the apparatus. It is, if I understand your mechanism correctly, an inevitable consequence of asking questions that venture beyond the prevailing patterns in your knowledge boxes.'

'The newspapers,' Thripp said miserably. 'Three years of *The Times*. They do print the most extraordinary rumours...'

'And your machine, having no means of distinguishing rumour from fact, has woven them together into a seamless tapestry of nonsense.' Holmes turned to address the assembled members. 'Gentlemen, you have witnessed something genuinely remarkable this evening—though perhaps not in the way Professor Thripp intended. This machine demonstrates, with perfect clarity, both the extraordinary potential and the profound danger of reasoning without understanding. It can produce text that *sounds* authoritative, that *reads* as though it were written by a knowledgeable human being, while being utterly, confidently, magnificently wrong.'

He paused, his gaze returning to the vast apparatus with its forest of tubes and its honeycomb of brass chambers, still hissing gently with residual steam.

'And yet,' Holmes continued, 'I would not have you think I dismiss Professor Thripp's achievement. The engineering is remarkable—genuinely so. To have constructed a mechanism that captures perfectly the statistical skeleton of human knowledge is a feat of considerable ingenuity. The principle is sound, even if it reveals certain... philosophical limitations. I suspect that future generations will look back upon this device as we now look upon the first faltering steam engines—primitive, perhaps, but pointing the way toward something that will transform the world. Whether that transformation will be for good or ill, I confess I cannot—'

He was interrupted by a sudden commotion from the corridor beyond the Green Salon. There came the sound of raised voices, rapid footsteps, and the unmistakable protestations of the porter—protestations delivered, I noted, at approximately twice his customary pace, which is to say still rather slowly.

'Sir, I really must insist—the demonstration is in progress—members only, sir—this is most irregular—'

The door burst open, and two men entered. The first was a wiry, ferret-faced fellow in a brown overcoat, with sharp eyes that swept the room in a practised manner suggesting long experience in assessing the occupants of spaces he had just invaded. Behind him loomed a uniformed constable, his helmet tucked under one arm and his expression conveying the particular blend of deference and authority that the Metropolitan Police cultivate for encounters with the genteel classes.

'Inspector Lestrade,' said Holmes, and I detected in his voice a note of genuine surprise—perhaps the first I had witnessed from him all evening. 'This is unexpected.'

Lestrade's sharp eyes fixed on Holmes, and his ferret features arranged themselves into an expression of equal astonishment. 'Mr. Holmes! What the devil are you doing here?'

'I was invited,' Holmes replied mildly. 'As a consultant, to evaluate a scientific apparatus. The more pertinent question, I think, is what brings Scotland Yard to the Chloratic Society Club at this hour, in such evident haste, and with'—his gaze dropped briefly to Lestrade's hand—'what appears to be a piece of physical evidence improperly removed from a crime scene.'

Lestrade had the grace to look slightly abashed. He was indeed holding something—a card of stiff paper, which he had been attempting to conceal within his palm. 'You know I wouldn't remove evidence without good reason, Mr. Holmes. But this—' He held up the card, and I saw that it was covered in a precise pattern of punched holes. 'This had the name of this club written on it. Inscribed on the back, in pencil. "The Chloratic Society, Pall Mall." I needed to know what it was, and I needed to know quickly.'

Professor Thripp made a strangled sound.

'There has been a murder,' Lestrade continued, his voice grim. 'Sir Reginald Blackwood, the industrialist. Found dead in his study not three hours ago. The doors were locked from the inside, the windows latched. No sign of forced entry, no apparent cause of death. The surgeon found no wound or poison. And this'—he brandished the card—'was found clutched in his hand.'

'Sir Reginald Blackwood,' murmured Sir Bartholomew, his florid face having gone somewhat pale. 'Good heavens. He was to have been our guest this evening. He sent his regrets only this morning—said he was indisposed.'

'He is rather more than indisposed now,' Holmes said. He crossed the room in three swift strides and plucked the card from Lestrade's unresisting fingers, holding it up to the gaslight. His grey eyes moved rapidly across the pattern of holes, and I saw his jaw tighten almost imperceptibly.

Lestrade watched him with the expression of a man who has long since accepted that certain irregularities are simply part of working with Sherlock Holmes. 'I was hoping someone here could tell me what that card means. I didn't expect that someone to be you.'

'The universe, it would seem, has a taste for dramatic coincidence,' Holmes murmured, still examining the card. He turned sharply. 'Professor Thripp, I require your expertise. Can you decode this?'

Thripp hurried forward, his earlier embarrassment entirely forgotten in the face of this new mystery. He took the card and examined it, his thick spectacles catching the light as he tilted it this way and that.

'It is encoded in my system,' he confirmed, his voice hushed. 'The hole patterns match precisely. This card was punched by someone who knows my machine—knows it intimately.' He looked up at Holmes, his perpetually startled eyes now wide with genuine alarm. 'It is a query, Mr. Holmes. Someone has posed a question.'

'What question?'

Thripp's throat worked as he translated the pattern of holes. When he spoke, his voice was barely above a whisper.

'"Who killed Sir Reginald Blackwood?"'

## CHAPTER III

*In Which a Query About Murder Produces an Answer About Patterns*

For a long moment, no one spoke. The question hung in the air of the Green Salon like a noxious vapour, and the gentlemen of the Chloratic Society stood frozen in attitudes of varying alarm, as though a photographer had captured them at the precise instant of collective discomfort. The constable shifted his weight from one foot to the other, clearly wishing he were elsewhere.

It was Holmes who broke the silence.

'Well, Professor,' he said, his voice carrying that particular quality of calm that I would come to recognise as the stillness before decisive action. 'We have a query. We have a machine designed to answer queries. The logical course of action seems evident.'

Thripp stared at him, his spectacles catching the gaslight. 'You cannot be serious, Mr. Holmes. To feed this card into the machine—a card connected to a murder—evidence in a police investigation—'

'Now hold on,' Lestrade interjected, his ferret features sharpening. 'That card is evidence, Mr. Holmes. I can't have you—'

'You came here to discover what the card means, Inspector.' Holmes's tone was patient, but only just. 'The card is a query, encoded for this specific machine. The only way to determine its significance is to see what response the machine produces. Unless you would prefer to take it to Scotland Yard and have your sergeants puzzle over it?'

Lestrade's jaw worked silently for a moment. 'Get on with it, then,' he said at last.

Holmes plucked the card from Thripp's unresisting fingers and moved toward the machine.

The effect was immediate. Deep within the mechanism, valves opened and closed in rapid succession. Steam rushed through the labyrinth of tubes with a sound like a sharp collective inhalation. The concept chambers flickered with subtle variations in pressure—I fancied I could almost see the patterns of activation rippling across the honeycomb, as though the machine were genuinely thinking, marshalling its seven hundred and forty-two brass concepts in pursuit of an answer.

The knowledge boxes began to clatter, faster than before. A high-pitched whine emerged from somewhere in the mechanism's depths—a sound Thripp clearly did not expect, for he took an involuntary step backward. Mr. Marsh, who had been standing unobtrusively beside the boiler, looked up with what might have been concern, though on his unremarkable features it was difficult to tell. The output arm trembled, descended toward the paper, and began to write.

The arm moved with mechanical precision, inscribing line after line. The paper fed through the mechanism at an alarming rate. Thripp's face cycled through expressions of bewilderment, concern, and something approaching fear. The assembled members of the Chloratic Society watched in mesmerised silence as the machine produced more text than it had generated in all the previous demonstrations combined.

At last, with a final hiss of steam and a decisive click, the output arm lifted and fell still.

Thripp tore off the paper—a strip nearly a feet long—and held it up to the light. His lips moved as he read, his already pale complexion fading to something approaching the colour of old chalk.

'What does it say?' Holmes demanded.

Thripp opened his mouth, closed it again, and simply handed the paper to Holmes. I moved closer, as did Lestrade, and we read over the detective's shoulder.

The machine had written:

*"Sir Reginald Blackwood was killed by THE PATTERN THAT SPEAKS. The death occurred in the study at half-past seven. The method was NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE. The next shall be the one who ASKS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING. The machine does not lie. The machine completes."*

A profound silence fell over the Green Salon.

'What in God's name,' Lestrade breathed, 'does that mean?'

Holmes did not answer immediately. His grey eyes moved over the text again and again, as though willing it to yield its secrets through sheer intensity of scrutiny. When he finally spoke, his voice was quiet—and, for the first time since I had observed him, thoughtful in a way that suggested genuine puzzlement rather than mere contemplation.

'The Pattern That Speaks,' he murmured. 'Necessary Consequence. Asks Without Understanding. These are not phrases one finds in the *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, Professor. Nor in Mrs. Beeton, I suspect.'

'They are not,' Thripp agreed, his voice unsteady. 'I have never seen the machine produce language like this. The capitalisations alone—the machine has no mechanism for emphasis. It should produce uniform text.'

Holmes fixed his grey eyes on Thripp with an intensity that made the professor take an involuntary step backward, 'I cannot shake the feeling that there is something about your machine, Professor, that you yourself do not fully understand. Some emergent property of those seven hundred and forty-two chambers and their myriad connexions that produces results you did not anticipate and cannot explain.'

'That is...' Thripp trailed off, his gaze drifting to the apparatus. 'That is not how machines work, Mr. Holmes.'

'No,' Holmes agreed. 'It is not. And yet here we are.' He placed the folded paper in his coat pocket. 'The time of death mentioned in the response—half-past seven. Inspector, can you confirm the actual time of death?'

Lestrade consulted a small notebook he produced from his coat. 'The body was discovered at quarter to nine by the housekeeper. The police surgeon estimates death occurred between seven and eight o'clock, based on the condition of the body.' He looked up, his ferret features pale. 'Half-past seven would fall squarely in that range.'

'A lucky guess,' Holmes said, though his tone suggested he did not entirely believe it. 'Or something else entirely. That detail may be pure invention, as my knighthood and trained falcon were inventions. Or it may not. The fact that it falls within the estimated range proves nothing—it is a reasonable guess for an evening murder. But it is... suggestive.'

Thripp's hands were trembling. 'I don't understand,' he said. 'I don't understand any of this.'

'Nor do I,' Holmes admitted. 'But I intend to'

'Inspector,' Holmes continued, turning to Lestrade, 'I presume you have no objection to my involvement in this case?'

Lestrade snorted. 'When have my objections ever stopped you, Mr. Holmes? Besides, this is beyond anything I've encountered. A locked room, no cause of death, and now a mechanical oracle spouting riddles.' He shook his head. 'I'll take whatever help I can get.'

Holmes fell silent for a moment, his gaze returning to the reasoning machine, which sat amid its forest of tubes and its cloud of residual steam, silent now, inscrutable, waiting.

'The next shall be the one who asks without understanding,' he murmured, half to himself. His grey eyes flickered toward Thripp, who had posed so many questions to his own creation, and then away. 'I wonder, Professor, whether your machine has just issued a warning—or a threat.'

'Inspector,' Holmes continued, turning to Lestrade, 'I suggest you proceed to the crime scene and secure it for my examination. I shall join you within the hour. There are matters I must first discuss with Professor Thripp—matters that may have bearing on the case.'

Lestrade looked as though he wished to object, but something in Holmes's expression dissuaded him. 'Very well, Mr. Holmes. But don't be long. The Commissioner will want answers, and I'd rather they came from you than from me trying to explain a mechanical fortune-teller.' He nodded to the constable, and the two of them departed, their footsteps echoing down the corridor.

The members of the Chloratic Society, sensing that the evening's entertainment had concluded—or perhaps that darker matters were now afoot—began to drift toward the door in twos and threes, murmuring amongst themselves, with Sir Bartholomew following them. Holmes raised a hand.

'A moment, gentlemen, if you would be so kind.' Holmes's voice was pleasant, but there was steel beneath it. 'I find myself in an awkward position. My colleague Dr. Watson is not present, and I have grown accustomed to having a companion during such conversations—someone to serve as witness, sounding board, and occasional voice of common sense. It is a habit I am loath to break.'

Sir Bartholomew's whiskers twitched with uncertainty. 'I would be honoured, of course, Mr. Holmes, but I confess I have little aptitude for detective work—'

'I was not thinking of you, Sir Bartholomew.' Holmes's gaze swept the room and settled, somewhat to my alarm, upon me. 'You there—I observed you earlier. You have been watching the proceedings with considerable attention, yet you have not spoken a word all evening. You neither rushed to examine the machine nor shrank from its pronouncements. You have the air of a man who observes rather than participates.' The ghost of a smile crossed his angular features. 'I find such men useful. What is your name?'

'Pennington,' I managed. 'Horace Pennington.'

'Mr. Pennington. Would you consent to join Professor Thripp and myself for a private conversation? I assure you it will be more interesting than whatever you had planned for the remainder of your evening.'

I glanced at Sir Bartholomew, who gave an encouraging nod, his whiskers suggesting relief at having been passed over. I glanced at Professor Thripp, who appeared too distracted by the evening's events to have an opinion on anything. And I glanced at the reasoning machine, still hissing faintly in its corner, tended by the silent Mr. Marsh.

'I would be honoured,' I heard myself say.

'Excellent.' Holmes clapped his hands together once. 'Sir Bartholomew, is there a private room where we might speak without interruption?'

'The Members' Study,' Sir Bartholomew offered. 'Second floor, at the end of the corridor. I shall have the porter bring up a fire and some brandy.'

'Brandy would be most welcome,' Holmes agreed. 'Professor Thripp, Mr. Pennington—if you would follow me.'

And so it was that I found myself trailing behind the most famous detective in England, ascending the stairs of the Chloratic Society Club toward a conversation that would ensure I did not sleep much that night. Behind us, the Green Salon fell silent, and the reasoning machine sat alone in the gaslight, its brass chambers cooling, its seven hundred and forty-two concepts settling into whatever passed, in that mechanical mind, for sleep.

*The machine completes*, it had written.

I wondered, as I climbed the stairs, what exactly it intended to complete—and whether any of us would be prepared when it did.

## CHAPTER IV

*In Which Mr. Holmes Enquires into Matters of Funding, Loyalty, and Punched Holes*

The Members' Study proved to be a small, wood-panelled room on the second floor, furnished with the sort of leather armchairs that seem designed to swallow their occupants whole. A fire had been laid but not yet lit, and the room carried the faint chill of disuse. Sir Bartholomew's promised brandy arrived moments after we did, borne by the porter with his customary glacial dignity, and I confess I was grateful for its warmth as I settled into one of the chairs.

Holmes did not sit. He stood by the window, gazing out at the fog-shrouded courtyard below, his sharp profile silhouetted against the gaslight from the street. Professor Thripp perched on the edge of an armchair opposite me, his spectacles slightly askew, his fingers worrying at a loose thread on his waistcoat. He had the look of a man awaiting sentence.

'Professor,' Holmes began, without turning from the window, 'I must ask you some questions that may seem impertinent. I assure you they are necessary. A man is dead, and your machine—however indirectly—appears to be connected to his death. I require complete candour.'

'Of course, Mr. Holmes. Anything I can do to assist.'

'Let us begin with Sir Reginald Blackwood.' Holmes turned now, his grey eyes fixing on Thripp with that unsettling intensity I had observed earlier. 'Sir Bartholomew mentioned that Blackwood was expected at this evening's demonstration. What was his connexion to your work?'

Thripp's fingers ceased their worrying. He was silent for a moment, and when he spoke, his voice carried a weight I had not heard before.

'Sir Reginald was my patron, Mr. Holmes. He financed the construction of the reasoning machine—every gear, every tube, every ounce of brass and copper. Without his support, the apparatus would never have existed.'

I saw Holmes's eyebrows rise slightly. 'Indeed? That is a considerable investment for a private individual. The machine must have cost—'

'Nearly ten thousand pounds over the course of four years,' Thripp confirmed. 'Sir Reginald was... most generous.'

'Generous.' Holmes repeated the word as though tasting it for hidden flavours. 'And what did Sir Reginald expect in return for this generosity? A share of any profits? Recognition?'

Thripp shook his head. 'Sir Reginald was not interested in profit, Mr. Holmes. He was interested in—' The professor paused, searching for the right word. 'In progress. In the betterment of humanity. He believed that a machine capable of genuine reasoning would transform society in ways we can scarcely imagine. Medicine. Law. Commerce. Even—' He glanced up at Holmes with something like embarrassment. 'Even crime fighting. He spoke often of how such a machine might assist the police in solving cases that would otherwise go unsolved. I believe, Mr. Holmes, that he rather hoped you might take an interest in it yourself.'

'How prescient of him,' Holmes murmured drily. 'And now he is dead, and I am indeed taking an interest—though not, I suspect, in the manner he envisioned.' He began to pace slowly before the empty fireplace, his hands clasped behind his back. 'Tell me, Professor—who else knew of the machine's existence before this evening?'

'Very few people, Mr. Holmes. Sir Reginald was most insistent on confidentiality.'

'Insistent? In what way?'

Thripp shifted uncomfortably in his chair. 'He believed—and I confess I came to share his belief—that premature disclosure would be... dangerous. Not physically dangerous, you understand, but dangerous to the project itself. There are those who would seek to suppress such an invention, or to steal it, or to discredit it before it could prove its worth. Sir Reginald felt that a public demonstration, properly staged, would be far more effective than gradual revelation. He wanted the world to see the machine in operation, to witness its capabilities firsthand, before anyone had the opportunity to poison opinion against it.'

'A reasonable precaution,' Holmes allowed. 'So who, precisely, was aware of the machine's existence?'

'Only three people, Mr. Holmes. Myself, of course. My assistant, Mr. Marsh—he has been invaluable in the construction and operation of the apparatus, though he has no particular understanding of its theoretical foundations. And Sir Reginald himself, who visited the workshop regularly to observe our progress.'

'No one else? No servants at your workshop? No colleagues at the Club?'

'Sir Reginald provided me with a private workshop in one of his properties—a disused carriage house in Clerkenwell, quite secluded. I have worked there alone, save for Mr. Marsh, for the past three years. And I have been deliberately vague with my colleagues here at the Chloratic Society. They knew I was working on something, of course—I am not skilled at dissembling—but the details remained obscure. Sir Bartholomew himself learned the full nature of my work only last week, when Sir Reginald and I approached him about hosting the demonstration.'

Holmes had stopped pacing. He stood very still, his gaze fixed on some point in the middle distance.

'Three people,' he said quietly. 'Three people knew of this machine. One of them is dead. One of them is you. And one of them is your assistant—the unremarkable Mr. Marsh, who even now tends to the apparatus downstairs.' He turned to face Thripp directly. 'Professor, I must ask you plainly: do you trust Mr. Marsh?'

Thripp blinked, apparently surprised by the question. 'Trust him? Why, yes—absolutely. Edwin has been with me for nearly four years. He is diligent, reliable, and entirely without ambition. I could not have completed the machine without him.'

'Entirely without ambition,' Holmes repeated. 'A rare quality in a young man. How did he come to be in your employ?'

'Sir Reginald recommended him, actually. Edwin had been working as a clerk in one of Sir Reginald's commercial ventures—something to do with shipping, I believe—and Sir Reginald felt his methodical nature would suit my requirements. He was quite right. Edwin follows instructions precisely and never asks unnecessary questions.'

'Never asks unnecessary questions.' Holmes's tone was unreadable. 'And he has access to the machine at all times? Understands its operation?'

'He understands the mechanical aspects—the boiler, the valves, the physical maintenance. The theoretical principles are rather beyond him, I'm afraid. But yes, he has access. He must, to perform his duties.'

'Including the encoding of query cards?'

'Oh, certainly. Edwin learned the encoding system early in his employment—he has a gift for such methodical work. In truth, his punching is as precise as my own, perhaps more so. His hand is steadier. He produced nearly all of the knowledge cards, in fact—tens of thousands of them. It would have taken me years to punch them all myself.'

'Does Mr. Marsh use a punching apparatus of his own?' Holmes enquired.

'No, no—there is only the one apparatus. Creating a punching device of sufficient precision is remarkably labour-intensive, Mr. Holmes. I spent the better part of three months constructing mine, and I confess I have no desire to repeat the experience. I preferred to focus my energies on the reasoning machine itself rather than the supporting machinery. Edwin and I simply share the one device.'

Holmes nodded slowly, as though a piece of a puzzle had clicked into place—though what pattern he was assembling, I could not begin to guess.

'One more question, Professor. The card that was found with Sir Reginald's body—the card bearing the question "Who killed Sir Reginald Blackwood?"—that card was punched using your encoding system. Punched, I would note, *before* the murder could have been widely known, since it was found in the dead man's hand. Who, in your estimation, could have created such a card?'

Thripp's face had gone pale. 'I... only myself or Edwin. No one else knows the encoding. Sir Reginald certainly didn't—he had no head for such technical matters.'

'So either you punched that card, Professor, or your assistant did. There is no third possibility.'

'I did not punch it, Mr. Holmes. I swear to you.'

Holmes regarded him for a long moment, his expression giving nothing away. Then he nodded, once, and some of the tension seemed to drain from the room.

'I believe you, Professor.' Holmes moved toward the door. 'Before I visit the crime scene, I should like to examine the machine more closely. There may be details of its construction that bear upon this case—details that would not be apparent to a casual observer.'

Thripp rose from his chair, relief evident on his features at having something practical to offer. 'Of course, Mr. Holmes. I shall be happy to explain any aspect of the apparatus you wish to understand.'

'Excellent.' Holmes turned to me, and I saw in his grey eyes something that might have been anticipation—the look of a hound catching a scent. 'Come, Mr. Pennington. Let us see what secrets the reasoning machine has yet to reveal.'

We descended the stairs and returned to the Green Salon, which had emptied entirely save for Mr. Marsh, who stood beside the now-silent apparatus with the patient stillness of a man accustomed to waiting. The gas lamps had been turned low, casting long shadows across the brass and copper surfaces of the machine, and the air still carried the faint mineral tang of spent steam.

'Mr. Marsh,' Holmes said, acknowledging the assistant with a brief nod. 'I trust you have no objection to my examining the machine?'

Marsh's expression—insofar as that unremarkable face could be said to have an expression—remained neutral. 'The Professor's wishes are my instructions, sir.'

'Quite so.' Holmes circled the apparatus slowly, his sharp eyes moving across every surface, every joint, every tube. He paused occasionally to peer more closely at some detail—a valve here, a connexion there—but did not touch anything. It was, I realised, the manner of a man reading a complex document, absorbing information before committing to any conclusions.

He moved to the front of the machine where the card slot and output mechanism were located, then turned his attention to the stack of demonstration cards that still sat in their case beside the apparatus.

'These cards,' he said, picking one up and holding it to the light. 'The queries you had prepared for this evening's demonstration. Your own work, Professor?'

'Yes, Mr. Holmes. I punched the demonstration cards myself—I wanted to ensure they were precisely correct for the unveiling.'

Holmes examined the card closely, tilting it toward the gaslight. He seemed to note something about it, though he made no comment. Then he replaced the demonstration card and moved around to the rear of the machine, where the large wooden boxes stood. 'And these are the knowledge cards you spoke of? The distilled essence of the *Encyclopaedia Britannica* and so forth?'

'Yes, Mr. Holmes. Tens of thousands of them. Edwin's work, primarily—as I mentioned, it would have taken me years to punch them all myself.'

Holmes opened one of the boxes and withdrew a card at random, examining it with close attention. Then he withdrew another, and another. His brow furrowed slightly, though whether from confusion or interest I could not determine. He held two cards side by side, tilting them toward the gaslight, his grey eyes moving rapidly across their surfaces.

'Fascinating,' he murmured, half to himself. He examined several more cards in silence, occasionally glancing toward the boxes with an expression I found difficult to read. At last, he returned the cards to their places and closed the lid with a soft click.

'Is something the matter, Mr. Holmes?' Thripp asked, a note of anxiety creeping into his voice.

'Matter? No, nothing at all. I merely wished to see the mechanism of your knowledge storage.' Holmes's tone was casual, but I noticed that his eyes lingered on the boxes for a moment longer before he turned away.

Holmes turned away from the machine. 'These cards—where do you obtain them?'

'From a specialty supplier in Birmingham,' Thripp replied, his voice faint. 'Hargreaves and Sons. They manufacture cards for Jacquard looms—the same principle, you understand, of using punched holes to convey information. I specified the dimensions and the card stock, and they produce them to my requirements.'

'And how many people would have access to cards of this precise specification?'

Thripp considered this. 'Anyone who placed an order with Hargreaves, I suppose. But the cards themselves are useless without knowledge of my encoding system. A blank card from Hargreaves would tell you nothing about how to punch a valid query.'

'Professor Thripp, you have been most helpful.' Holmes retrieved his hat from where he had left it on one of the displaced armchairs. 'I have no further questions for you this evening. You and Mr. Marsh may go home and get some rest—though I would ask that you both remain available should I need to speak with you again.'

'Of course, Mr. Holmes,' Thripp said, though his voice was hollow. He was still staring at the knowledge boxes. 'We shall be at your disposal.'

Holmes had turned toward the door, but now he paused and looked back at Thripp. 'One more thing, Professor. The machine's response to the query about Sir Reginald's death—you said the capitalisations were impossible. That the machine has no mechanism for emphasis.'

'That is correct, Mr. Holmes.'

'And yet it produced them. "THE PATTERN THAT SPEAKS." "NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE." "ASKS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING." All in capitals, as though the machine wished to draw particular attention to these phrases.'

Thripp spread his hands helplessly. 'I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes. It should not have happened.'

'No,' Holmes agreed. 'It should not.' He settled his hat upon his head. 'And yet it did. That, Professor, is what makes this case so very interesting.'

He swept out of the room, and I hurried after him, leaving Thripp and his silent assistant to extinguish the lamps and secure the reasoning machine for the night.

## CHAPTER V

*In Which a Crime Scene Is Examined and Inspector Lestrade Demonstrates His Powers of Deduction*

The fog had thickened considerably by the time Holmes and I emerged from the Chloratic Society Club onto Pall Mall. It was the particular variety of London fog that seems less like weather than like a living presence—a cold, damp creature that wraps itself around lampposts and lurks in doorways, muffling sound and transforming familiar streets into passages from some uneasy dream. Holmes raised his arm, and within moments a hansom cab materialised from the murk, its horse snorting clouds of vapour that mingled indistinguishably with the fog itself.

'Belgrave Square,' Holmes told the driver. 'Sir Reginald Blackwood's residence. And quickly, if you please.'

We climbed into the cab, and as it lurched into motion, I found myself sitting opposite the most famous detective in England, uncertain whether I was expected to speak or to maintain a respectful silence. Holmes resolved the question for me.

'You are wondering, Mr. Pennington, why I asked you to accompany me rather than proceeding alone.'

It was not a question, but I answered anyway. 'The thought had crossed my mind.'

'Watson serves a dual purpose in my investigations,' Holmes said, his gaze directed not at me but at the fog-shrouded streets passing beyond the window. 'He provides companionship, which I find more agreeable than I once supposed. But more importantly, he provides a perspective different from my own. A sounding board, as I mentioned earlier. I observe; he reacts. I analyse; he questions. The interplay between these modes of thought has proven surprisingly productive.'

'I am flattered that you think I might serve a similar function.'

'You observed the evening's events with attention but without interference. You asked no foolish questions. You did not flinch when confronted with talk of murder.' The ghost of a smile crossed Holmes's angular features. 'These are not inconsiderable qualifications. We shall see how you fare at the crime scene.'

I confess I was not entirely reassured.

Sir Reginald Blackwood's residence proved to be a handsome townhouse of white stone, its windows dark save for a faint glow from the ground floor. A uniformed constable stood guard at the front door, stamping his feet against the cold, and he straightened visibly as our cab drew up.

'Mr. Holmes,' the constable said, recognising my companion immediately. 'Inspector Lestrade said you might be coming. He's inside, sir, in the study.'

'Excellent. Come, Mr. Pennington.'

We passed through a marble-floored entrance hall and up a flight of stairs, following the constable's directions to a door at the end of a wood-panelled corridor. The door stood open, and I could see lamplight within.

We were intercepted at the threshold by a young man of perhaps thirty years, with an open, handsome face and the kind of easy manner that immediately puts one at ease. He had clearly been weeping—his eyes were red-rimmed—but he composed himself quickly and extended his hand.

'You must be Mr. Holmes,' he said, his voice warm despite its evident strain. 'I am Charles Fairweather, Sir Reginald's private secretary. I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you have come. If anyone can make sense of this dreadful business, it is you.'

'You are too kind, Mr. Fairweather.' Holmes shook the offered hand briefly. 'I understand you were in the household this evening?'

'I was working late in my office—down the corridor from the study. I heard nothing, saw nothing, until Mrs. Pemberton—the housekeeper—raised the alarm.' Fairweather's composure wavered for a moment. 'I was the one who broke down the door, Mr. Holmes. The study was locked from inside. Sir Reginald was slumped at his desk, and there was no one else in the room. No one at all. I have racked my brain trying to understand how it could have happened.'

'Your assistance will be invaluable, I am sure,' Holmes said. 'For now, however, I must speak with Inspector Lestrade. Perhaps we might talk further before I leave?'

'Of course, of course. Anything I can do to help.' Fairweather stepped aside with evident reluctance, his eagerness to assist almost palpable. 'I shall be in the morning room whenever you need me.'

Lestrade looked up as we entered the study proper. He was standing beside a large mahogany desk, his ferret features arranged in an expression that combined professional gravity with something that looked almost like satisfaction.

'Mr. Holmes. I was beginning to think you'd decided to leave this one to the professionals.'

'I was detained at the Club,' Holmes replied, his eyes already moving systematically around the room. 'There were questions that required answers.'

'Yes, well, I've been doing a bit of questioning myself.' Lestrade rocked back on his heels, clearly pleased with himself. 'And a bit of deducing, if you'll permit me to use your terminology. You're not the only one who can put two and two together, Mr. Holmes.'

'Indeed?' Holmes had moved to the window and was examining the latch with close attention. 'Pray enlighten me, Inspector.'

'That card—the one found in the dead man's hand. I've been thinking about it.' Lestrade pulled the card from his coat pocket and held it up. 'Someone punched this card. Someone who knew how to use that infernal machine's coding system. Now, Professor Thripp invented the code. But you know what I think?'

'I am agog with anticipation.'

If Lestrade detected the irony in Holmes's tone, he gave no sign of it. 'I think that assistant of his—what's his name, Marsh—I think he knows more than he lets on. Quiet type, isn't he? The kind who watches and listens and keeps his mouth shut. Four years he's been working with that machine. You can't tell me he hasn't picked up the coding system in all that time.'

Holmes had moved from the window to the fireplace, where he knelt to examine the ashes. 'A reasonable supposition,' he said, without looking up.

'More than reasonable, Mr. Holmes. It's the only explanation that makes sense.' Lestrade's satisfaction was evident. 'Thripp didn't punch that card—he's got no motive, and besides, he seemed genuinely shocked when he saw it. So who does that leave? The assistant. The quiet, unremarkable Mr. Marsh, who everyone overlooks because he's so thoroughly ordinary.'

'The invisible man,' Holmes murmured, rising from the fireplace and brushing the soot from his fingers.

'Exactly! Hide in plain sight, that's his game. Well, he won't hide from Scotland Yard.' Lestrade straightened his coat with an air of determination. 'I'm going to send a couple of constables to bring him in for questioning. Tonight, before he has a chance to disappear.'

I watched Holmes's face carefully, expecting him to object, to point out some flaw in Lestrade's reasoning that had escaped the Inspector's notice. Instead, Holmes simply nodded.

'An excellent plan, Lestrade. By all means, bring Mr. Marsh in for questioning. A few hours of scrutiny at Scotland Yard may prove most illuminating.' He paused, as though a thought had just occurred to him. 'Though I wonder if you are casting your net wide enough.'

'Wide enough? What do you mean?'

'Professor Thripp.' Holmes's tone was thoughtful, almost musing. 'We have been assuming his innocence, but consider: he is the only person who *certainly* knows the encoding system. Marsh may have learned it through observation, but Thripp invented it. He had complete access to the machine, to the cards, to Sir Reginald himself. And Sir Reginald was his patron—the source of his funding. What if there was a dispute? A disagreement over the direction of the research, or the terms of their arrangement?'

Lestrade's ferret features sharpened with renewed interest. 'You think Thripp might be involved?'

'I think,' Holmes said carefully, 'that it would be premature to exclude him. The absent-minded professor, so absorbed in his work that he scarcely knows what day it is—it is a compelling performance. But is it genuine? Or is it a mask, designed to make us underestimate him?'

Lestrade slapped his hand against his thigh with evident satisfaction. 'By God, Mr. Holmes, you're right. I'll bring them both in. Thripp and Marsh, together. Let them explain themselves to Scotland Yard.'

'A prudent course of action,' Holmes agreed.

'You know, Mr. Holmes,' Lestrade said, a broad smile spreading across his face, 'I've always said you'd make a fine detective if only you were more of a man of action and less of a... well, a contemplator. All that sitting about in armchairs, smoking pipes and thinking. But tonight—tonight you've shown some real police instinct. Decisive. Practical. I like it.'

'High praise indeed, Inspector.'

'I mean it.' Lestrade straightened his coat, visibly pleased with the evening's developments. 'Right, then. I'll have constables collect them within the hour.'

'Before you go, Inspector,' Holmes said, 'might I examine the card? The one found in Sir Reginald's hand?'

Lestrade hesitated for only a moment, then shrugged and handed it over. 'Keep it if you like, Mr. Holmes. I've no need for it now that the culprits are as good as apprehended. The card led us to the machine, the machine led us to Thripp and Marsh—the chain of evidence is complete.'

'Most generous,' Holmes murmured, holding the card up to the lamplight and studying it with intense concentration. 'Most generous indeed.'

Lestrade departed, calling for one of the constables, and I found myself alone with Holmes in the dead man's study. The detective had resumed his examination of the room, moving now to the desk where, I presumed, Sir Reginald had met his end.

The study was handsomely appointed—bookshelves lined the walls, a fire had burned low in the grate, and heavy curtains were drawn across the windows. The desk dominated the centre of the room, and my attention was drawn to a shape outlined in chalk upon its surface.

'That is where the body was found,' Holmes confirmed, following my gaze. 'Seated at the desk, slumped forward. The card was in his right hand, which had fallen to his side. There was no sign of struggle, no defensive wounds, no indication that Sir Reginald had any warning of his fate.  Sir Reginald Blackwood simply... stopped living.'

I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature of the room. 'Is such a thing possible?'

'It is possible for a man to die of heart failure, of apoplexy, of any number of natural causes. But the timing, Mr. Pennington—the timing is what disturbs me. A man who has financed a reasoning machine for four years, who has kept its existence secret, who was expected at its public unveiling—this man dies on the very evening of the demonstration, with a card in his hand that asks who killed him, as though he knew his death was murder before it occurred.'

'Perhaps he did know,' I said slowly. 'Perhaps someone threatened him. Perhaps he punched the card himself, knowing he was in danger, hoping that the machine might somehow reveal his killer.'

Holmes regarded me with renewed interest. 'A fascinating theory, Mr. Pennington. It would explain why the card was found in his hand rather than near the machine. But it raises another question: if Blackwood punched the card himself, he must have learned the encoding system—despite Thripp's assertion that he had no head for such technical matters.'

'People can surprise us.'

'Indeed they can.' Holmes smiled thinly. 'Indeed they can.'

He spent the next quarter-hour examining every inch of the study—the desk drawers, the bookshelves, the windows, the fireplace. I watched in silence, reluctant to interrupt his concentration. Occasionally he would pause and make a small sound of interest, or peer more closely at some detail invisible to me. At last, he straightened and brushed the dust from his knees.

'I have seen enough for tonight,' he announced. 'The hour is late, and I must think. Mr. Pennington, I shall put you in a cab back to your lodgings. We shall speak again tomorrow.'

'What will you do?'

'I shall walk.' Holmes retrieved his hat from where he had set it upon a side table. 'The fog is conducive to thought, and I have a great deal to think about.'

We made our way out of the study and down the corridor toward the entrance hall. As we descended the stairs, Mr. Fairweather emerged from a doorway to intercept us, his handsome features arranged in an expression of earnest concern.

'Mr. Holmes! You are leaving?' He glanced between us, his manner as warm and eager as it had been upon our arrival. 'I do hope you have found something that will help bring Sir Reginald's killer to justice. He was a remarkable man, Mr. Holmes—truly remarkable. I admired him greatly. To think that someone could have...' He shook his head, apparently overcome.

'Your devotion to your employer does you credit, Mr. Fairweather,' Holmes said. 'And yes, I believe I have found several things of interest. The investigation proceeds.'

'If there is anything I can do—anything at all—you have only to ask. I knew Sir Reginald's affairs better than anyone. His correspondence, his appointments, his business dealings—I managed it all. I am entirely at your disposal.'

Most kind.' Holmes paused, as though struck by a sudden thought. 'There is one small matter, now that you mention it. A trifle, really, but it has been nagging at me. I have been considering acquiring a cat for my rooms in Baker Street. Would you recommend them as companions?'

Fairweather's smile remained fixed, but something flickered behind his eyes. 'I cannot say I have given the matter much thought, Mr. Holmes. I am not particularly fond of cats myself.'

'Ah.' Holmes nodded, his expression betraying nothing. 'Not fond of cats. Well, that is useful to know. Thank you, Mr. Fairweather. You have been most helpful.'

'Of course, Mr. Holmes,' Fairweather replied, his composure unruffled. 'Any time. Please do not hesitate to call upon me if you have further questions.'

'I shall not hesitate,' Holmes assured him. 'Good evening, Mr. Fairweather.'

We stepped out into the fog-shrouded street, and Holmes raised his arm to summon a cab for me. As we waited, I could not resist asking.

'The cat, Mr. Holmes? What was the purpose of that question?'

Holmes's thin lips curved into a private smile. 'The purpose, Mr. Pennington, was to receive an answer. And the answer I received was instructive.' He handed me into the cab as it drew up. 'Sleep well. Tomorrow, I suspect, will be a most eventful day.'

## CHAPTER VI

*In Which Mr. Pennington Makes an Observation, and Mr. Holmes Finds It Most Illuminating*

I slept poorly that night, as I had suspected I would. My dreams were troubled by visions of brass chambers and hissing steam, of punched cards fluttering like moths in the darkness, and of a machine that spoke in riddles while a dead man sat slumped at his desk, asking who had killed him. I woke before dawn, unrested and ill at ease, and found myself unable to return to sleep.

By half past eight I had breakfasted—though I could not say what I had eaten—and by nine I was walking through the fog toward Pall Mall, drawn back to the Chloratic Society Club by an impulse I could not quite name. Perhaps I hoped to find Holmes there, already at work on the mystery. Perhaps I simply wished to assure myself that the events of the previous evening had not been some elaborate dream.

The Club, when I arrived, was in a state of considerable agitation.

I had never seen so many members present at such an early hour. They clustered in the entrance hall and the reading room, speaking in urgent, hushed voices. The porter, whose customary bow had accelerated to something approaching normal human speed—a sure sign of crisis—informed me that Sir Bartholomew was in the smoking room and wished to speak with me.

I found the Chairman ensconced in his usual armchair, but there was nothing usual about his demeanour. His magnificent whiskers, normally so composed, appeared to have been subjected to considerable agitated stroking, and his florid complexion had deepened to something approaching beetroot.

'Pennington!' he exclaimed as I entered. 'Thank heavens. Have you heard the news?'

'I have heard nothing, Sir Bartholomew. I came directly here upon waking.'

'The police,' Sir Bartholomew said, pronouncing the word as though it were an obscenity. 'The police have detained Professor Thripp. Taken him away in the night like a common criminal. And that assistant of his—what was his name—'

'Marsh,' I supplied.

'Marsh, yes. That rascal.' Sir Bartholomew's whiskers quivered with indignation. 'Do you know, I was the one who recommended him to Thripp? Sir Reginald asked me if I knew of a reliable young man who might assist with a scientific project, and I put forward Marsh's name. He had done some clerical work for one of my own concerns—seemed a decent, steady fellow, nothing remarkable but nothing objectionable. And now it transpires he may be a murderer!'

'We do not know that he is guilty, Sir Bartholomew.'

'No, no, of course not. Innocent until proven guilty and all that.' The Chairman did not sound convinced. 'But the police would not have detained him without cause, would they? And Thripp—Thripp, of all people! A man of science, a member of this Club, a gentleman! To think that such a person might have...' He trailed off, shaking his head. 'It is too dreadful to contemplate.'

I was spared the necessity of a response by the arrival of a familiar figure in the doorway.

Holmes looked, if anything, even more alert than he had the previous evening. His grey eyes were bright, his movements quick and precise, and there was an air of suppressed energy about him that suggested a hound straining at the leash.

'Ah, Mr. Pennington,' he said. 'I had hoped to find you here. Sir Bartholomew, good morning. I trust you are well?'

'Well?' Sir Bartholomew sputtered. 'How can I be well when members of this Club are being hauled off to Scotland Yard? When the good name of the Chloratic Society is being dragged through the mud? When—'

'Quite so, quite so.' Holmes's tone was soothing but brisk. 'I understand your distress, Sir Bartholomew, and I hope to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. To that end, I require access to the Green Salon—and to Professor Thripp's machine.'

'The machine is still there,' Sir Bartholomew confirmed. 'No one has touched it since last night. I gave orders that the room was to remain sealed.'

'Excellent. I should like to conduct a brief examination, with Mr. Pennington as my witness. And I must ask that you close the doors behind us and ensure that no one enters until we have finished.'

Sir Bartholomew's whiskers twitched with curiosity, but he nodded. 'Very well, Mr. Holmes. If it will help clear up this dreadful business.'

We made our way to the Green Salon, where the reasoning machine stood exactly as we had left it the night before—silent, dark, its brass surfaces cold to the touch. The gas lamps had been extinguished, and the morning light filtering through the windows gave the apparatus an almost melancholy aspect, like some great beast that had been abandoned by its keeper.

Sir Bartholomew closed the doors behind us.

'I paid a visit to Scotland Yard,' Holmes explained, 'I have certain connexions there, which allowed me to speak with the Professor privately for a few minutes. I asked him to provide me with precise instructions for operating this punching device—the encoding system, the positioning of holes, the sequence of operations required to produce a valid query card.'

He set to work at the apparatus, consulting the papers frequently. His long fingers moved with careful precision, and I heard a series of small, decisive clicks as holes were punched into a blank card.

'You intend to use the machine yourself?' I asked.

'I intend to conduct an experiment.' Holmes held up the completed card, examining it against the light. Satisfied, he moved to the rear of the machine, where the boiler sat cold and dark. 'The Professor assured me that the machine requires approximately twenty minutes to build sufficient steam pressure. We shall have to wait.'

He opened the boiler's iron door, arranged kindling and coal with the practised efficiency of a man accustomed to self-sufficiency, and struck a match. The fire caught quickly, and soon a steady glow illuminated the brass fittings from below. Holmes closed the door and consulted his pocket watch. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, the machine began to stir—a faint hiss here, a whisper of steam there, as though it were drawing breath after a long sleep.

Holmes turned to me. 'As we are waiting, Mr. Pennington, I wished to have your perspective on certain aspects of this case.'

'My perspective? I am hardly qualified—'

'On the contrary. You have observed everything I have observed, yet you bring to it a fresh eye, unclouded by professional habit. Tell me: what did you make of the machine's response to the question of who killed Sir Reginald Blackwood?'

I considered this carefully before answering. 'It struck me as highly unusual,' I said at last. 'The language was... cryptic. Oracular, even. "The Pattern That Speaks." "Necessary Consequence." It sounded less like the output of a reasoning machine and more like the pronouncements of a fortune-teller. The sort of thing one might hear from a medium at a séance—vague enough to mean anything, yet phrased to sound profound.'

Holmes's eyes gleamed. 'Excellent. And what of the circumstances of Sir Reginald's death?'

'They seem almost unreal,' I admitted. 'A man found dead in a locked room, with no apparent cause of death, no sign of an intruder, no evidence of how the crime was committed. The perpetrator has vanished into thin air. It is the sort of thing one reads about in mystery novels—an impossible crime, designed to baffle the reader.'

'Precisely!' Holmes clapped his hands together once, a sharp sound in the quiet room. 'Mr. Pennington, you have struck upon it exactly. The machine's response sounds like a fortune-teller's pronouncement. The death seems like something out of a mystery novel. Your intuition has grasped what your conscious mind has not yet articulated.'

I stared at him, utterly at a loss. 'I confess I do not understand, Mr. Holmes. How does this observation help us?'

'It helps us enormously—if we follow the logic of your intuition to its conclusion.' Holmes walked to the gauge panel and began adjusting knobs. 'But I must clarify a few more points before I can explain fully. There are threads I must trace, connexions I must verify. Once I have done so, I shall lay out the entire case for you—and you will see that it is considerably simpler than it might appear at first glance.'

'Simpler?' I could not keep the incredulity from my voice. 'A man is dead without apparent cause. A machine speaks in riddles. Two men have been detained, and yet you seem uncertain of their guilt. How can any of this be simple?'

Holmes turned and looked back at me, and for a moment I saw something like sympathy in his angular features.

'The most elaborate illusions, Mr. Pennington, are often the simplest in their construction. The magician's art lies not in the complexity of his mechanism, but in the misdirection of his audience's attention. Ah, I believe the machine is ready!'

Holmes moved to the front of the apparatus where the card slot waited. Without ceremony, he inserted the card.

The effect was immediate. The mechanism stirred to life with a now-familiar symphony of clicks, hisses, and the flutter of knowledge cards being sorted in their boxes. The concept chambers flickered with subtle variations in pressure. The output arm descended, trembled, and began to write.

And write. The arm moved steadily across the paper, line after line, the response far longer than I had anticipated. Holmes watched with an expression of intense concentration as the machine produced what must have been several paragraphs of text. At last, with a final click, the arm lifted and fell still.

Holmes tore off the paper—a considerable length of it—and read it in silence, his grey eyes moving rapidly across the paper. His expression remained unreadable, though I fancied I saw a flicker of satisfaction cross his angular features. Then he folded the paper carefully and slipped it into his pocket.

'Just as I expected,' he murmured.

'What did you ask it?' I could not help but enquire.

'A question the answer to which was of the sort I expected.' He turned to face me, his grey eyes thoughtful. 'I shall return this afternoon, if all goes well. In the meantime, I suggest you remain at the Club. You may find the day's developments... instructive.'

And with that cryptic pronouncement, he was gone, leaving me alone with the reasoning machine, which hissed and burbled softly to itself as though contemplating mysteries of its own.

## CHAPTER VII

*In Which Holmes Delivers a Lecture on Human Nature, Interrupted by an Illustration of Same*

The afternoon had worn on in a state of peculiar suspension. I remained at the Club as Holmes had suggested, though I could not have said precisely what I was waiting for. The other members came and went, speaking in hushed voices of the morning's events, casting occasional glances toward the closed doors of the Green Salon. I took luncheon in the dining room, though I tasted nothing, and afterward installed myself in the reading room with a newspaper I did not read.

It was shortly after three o'clock when Sir Bartholomew emerged from his office in a state of considerable agitation—though by now, I reflected, agitation had become his customary condition.

'Pennington!' he exclaimed, spotting me among the leather armchairs. 'Thank heavens you are still here. I have received a message from Mr. Holmes. He requests—no, he insists—that I convene an emergency meeting of all members present in the Club. In the Green Salon. Immediately.'

'Did he say why?'

'He said only that he intends to resolve this matter once and for all, and that everyone deserves to witness the resolution.' Sir Bartholomew's whiskers twitched with a mixture of anxiety and anticipation. 'I confess I do not know what to make of it, but one does not refuse Sherlock Holmes. Not in a matter of murder.'

Within the quarter-hour, some two dozen members had assembled in the Green Salon, arranged in a rough semicircle before the reasoning machine, which still stood in its place of honour like a silent witness to the proceedings. The gas lamps had been lit against the grey afternoon light, and their glow lent the brass and copper surfaces of the apparatus a warm, almost living quality. I noticed that several members kept their distance from the machine, as though it might reach out and accuse them.

The doors opened, and Holmes entered.

He was not alone. Behind him came Inspector Lestrade, his ferret features arranged in an expression of profound irritation, and behind Lestrade came two uniformed constables, their presence lending the proceedings an air of official gravity that sent a murmur through the assembled members.

'Mr. Holmes,' Lestrade was saying, his voice carrying clearly through the room, 'I hope you have a very good reason for dragging me away from Scotland Yard. I have two suspects in custody, a mountain of paperwork, and the Commissioner breathing down my neck. I do not have time for theatrical demonstrations.'

'Patience, Inspector.' Holmes moved to the centre of the room, positioning himself before the reasoning machine with the easy confidence of a man entirely in command of his surroundings. 'I promise you that your time will not be wasted. Indeed, I suspect you will find this afternoon's proceedings most rewarding.'

He turned to address the assembled members, and I was struck again by the commanding presence he projected—tall, angular, his grey eyes sweeping the room with that cataloguing intensity I had come to recognise.

'Gentlemen of the Chloratic Society,' he began, 'I must first thank you for gathering on such short notice. The events of the past twenty-four hours have been extraordinary, and I believe that everyone present—everyone who witnessed the demonstration of Professor Thripp's remarkable machine, everyone who heard its cryptic pronouncement regarding the death of Sir Reginald Blackwood—deserves to be present for the unveiling of the truth.'

He paused, allowing his words to settle over the assembly.

'This Club,' he continued, 'prides itself on its appreciation of scientific progress. Its members believe that machinery and invention will transform the world for the better. These are admirable sentiments. I share many of them myself.'

Holmes began to pace slowly before the machine, his hands clasped behind his back.

'But in our enthusiasm for the machine, we must not forget that every machine is controlled by human hands—and human hands may be guided by corrupt motives. A machine does not want. A machine does not scheme. A machine does not murder. But nor does it inquire into the ends its master intends for it.'

He stopped pacing and turned to face the assembly directly.

'This case, I regret to say, has demonstrated that truth with painful clarity. Professor Thripp's machine is a marvel of ingenuity—but it was corrupted by a man who saw in it not a tool for enlightenment, but an instrument for—'

At that moment, the doors of the Green Salon swung open.

Mr. Charles Fairweather walked in.

He was dressed immaculately, as before, his handsome face wearing that same expression of open, eager helpfulness that had struck me so forcibly at the crime scene. He paused just inside the doorway, looking around at the assembled company with apparent surprise.

'Mr. Holmes,' he said, his voice warm and concerned, 'I received your message. I came as quickly as I could. Is there some way I can be of assistance?'

'Indeed there is, Mr. Fairweather.' Holmes's tone was pleasant, almost cordial. 'I am grateful that you could join us. Gentlemen'—he turned to address the assembly—'allow me to introduce Mr. Charles Fairweather, private secretary to the late Sir Reginald Blackwood. A most helpful and cooperative young man, as I can personally attest.'

Fairweather inclined his head modestly, accepting the introduction with easy grace.

'Last night you, Lestrade, already made acquaintance of Mr. Fairweather.' Holmes continued, and his voice hardened almost imperceptibly, 'For you today I should like to make a different introduction. Inspector, allow me to present Mr. Charles "the Conjuror" Moran—confidence trickster, forger, and suspected architect of no fewer than three elaborate frauds across the Continent. I believe your colleagues in Paris and Vienna have been rather eager to meet him.'

Lestrade had gone very still. His ferret features had sharpened with sudden recognition, and when he spoke, his voice carried a note of something approaching awe.

'Charles the Conjuror,' he breathed. 'Good Lord. I've heard of you for years. The Rotterdam diamond switch. The Marseilles inheritance fraud. That business with the Austrian countess and the forged Titian.' He shook his head slowly. 'They say you've been unmasked half a dozen times across Europe, but you always slip away before the handcuffs close. Vanish into thin air, like your namesake. The Sûreté has a file on you thick as a Bible, and police forces from London to Vienna have been chasing your shadow for the better part of a decade.'

Fairweather—Moran—had gone pale. His mouth opened and closed several times before he managed to speak.

'I... that is to say... the Rotterdam affair was never...' He caught himself, but too late. The admission, half-formed as it was, hung in the air like a confession.

'Thank you, Mr. Moran,' Holmes said drily. 'Your candour is appreciated, if belated.'

Lestrade was staring at the man with an expression that mingled professional satisfaction with genuine bewilderment. 'I knew of his reputation as a confidence trickster, Mr. Holmes. A swindler of the highest order. But I never imagined—murder? The Conjuror's trademark has always been that no one gets hurt. He takes their money, their jewels, their dignity, but never their lives. I cannot picture him as the man who killed Sir Reginald Blackwood.'

'Nor can I, Inspector.' Holmes's voice was calm, almost conversational. 'Because he did not kill Sir Reginald Blackwood.'

A murmur of confusion rippled through the assembled members. Lestrade's brow furrowed deeply.

'But you just said—the accusations—if he didn't kill Blackwood, then why—'

'I said he did not kill Sir Reginald Blackwood,' Holmes repeated. 'I did not say no one was killed. A man certainly died in that study. But the man who died was not Sir Reginald.'

The silence that followed was absolute. I found myself gripping the arms of my chair, my mind reeling as it tried to make sense of Holmes's words.

'Not Sir Reginald?' Lestrade sputtered. 'But the body—the household identified him—his own secretary identified him—' He gestured toward Moran, then stopped, realisation dawning on his face.

'Precisely.' Holmes permitted himself a thin smile. 'Inspector, if you were to visit the Grand Metropolitan Hotel in Brighton and enquire at the front desk for a Mr. Jonathan Cavendish, I believe you would have the distinct pleasure of meeting Sir Reginald Blackwood in excellent health. He has been registered there since yesterday afternoon—some hours before his supposed death.'

Moran made a strangled sound. Whatever composure he had maintained now deserted him entirely. His handsome face had gone the colour of old parchment.

'How could you possibly—' he began, then stopped himself.

'However,' Holmes continued, as though Moran had not spoken, 'The living Sir Reginald should be apprehended at once, before word of this afternoon's proceedings reaches him and he attempts to disappear. He has, after all, demonstrated considerable skill in that matter.'

Lestrade stood frozen for a moment, his mind visibly working through the implications. Then, with an almost physical effort, he shook off his stupefaction and reassumed the brisk manner of a man of action.

'Right,' he said, his voice firm. 'Right. Brighton. The Grand Metropolitan. Mr. Jonathan Cavendish.' He turned to the constables. 'You—' he pointed to the larger of the two—'get yourself to Scotland Yard immediately. Release Professor Thripp and his assistant—they're to be freed at once with apologies. Then gather reinforcements and proceed to Brighton. The Grand Metropolitan Hotel, a man registered as Jonathan Cavendish. Arrest him on charges of fraud and conspiracy. Do not let him slip away.'

The constable saluted and departed at speed, the urgency of his mission evident in every stride.

'And you,' Lestrade continued, turning to the remaining constable, 'keep hold of this one.' He jerked his thumb toward Moran. 'Charles Moran, I am arresting you on suspicion of fraud, conspiracy, and—' he glanced at Holmes—'whatever else Mr. Holmes is about to tell me you've done.'

The constable moved forward and took hold of Moran's arm. The man offered no resistance; he seemed almost to have deflated, the charm and vitality draining out of him until nothing remained but a hollow shell in an expensive suit.

Lestrade turned back to Holmes, his ferret features sharp with mingled frustration and curiosity.

'A man who isn't dead,' he muttered, shaking his head. 'A secretary who's actually a swindler. A machine that speaks in riddles.' He snorted. 'And people wonder why I preferred it when crimes were simple. Now then, Mr. Holmes—I believe you owe all of us an explanation.'

'Indeed I do, Inspector.' Holmes surveyed the assembly—the bewildered members of the Chloratic Society, the silent reasoning machine, the deflated figure of Moran held fast by the constable. 'Indeed I do.'

## CHAPTER VIII

*In Which the Chloratic Society Receives a Lecture on Deception, with Practical Demonstrations

Holmes surveyed the assembly for a long moment—the bewildered members of the Chloratic Society in their chairs, the silent reasoning machine looming behind him, Lestrade standing with arms crossed and ferret features sharp with impatience, the remaining constable maintaining his grip on the deflated figure of Moran. Even the elderly barrister who had wandered in from the reading room was present, his face displaying utter incomprehension. Sir Bartholomew's whiskers had achieved a state of agitation I had not previously thought possible.

'Gentlemen,' Holmes said at last, his voice calm and measured, 'I promised you an explanation, and an explanation you shall have. The events of the past day have been extraordinary, and you deserve to understand how a murder that never occurred came to dominate our attention, while the true crime—an elaborate fraud of remarkable audacity—proceeded almost unnoticed.'

He moved to stand beside the reasoning machine, resting one hand lightly upon its brass surface.

'Let me begin at the beginning—or rather, at the moment when I first suspected that something was profoundly amiss. It was not the death of Sir Reginald that alerted me, nor the mysterious card found in his hand. It was something far simpler: a remark made by Professor Thripp regarding the machine's response to that card.'

Holmes paused, allowing his words to settle.

'You will recall that when the machine produced its cryptic pronouncement—"THE PATTERN THAT SPEAKS," "NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE," "ASKS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING"—Professor Thripp expressed bewilderment not merely at the content of the response, but at its form. The capitalisations, he said, were impossible. The machine, by its very design, had no mechanism for producing emphasis. It should have rendered all text in uniform characters.'

Several members nodded, recalling the moment.

'And yet,' Holmes continued, 'the capitals were there. Unmistakably present. Which meant that someone, somehow, had tampered with the machine—had altered its behaviour in a way its own creator could not explain.'

He began to pace slowly before the apparatus, his hands clasped behind his back.

'I confess that initially I was at a loss to understand how such tampering might be accomplished. This machine is unlike any I have previously encountered. Its principle of operation is entirely novel. I am accustomed to examining devices where the mechanism is transparent—where gears turn shafts, where springs release catches, where the physical arrangement of parts determines the outcome. Here, the physical components—the tubes, the valves, the chambers—appeared entirely intact. There were no signs of damage, no evidence that anyone had altered the mechanical structure of the apparatus.'

Holmes stopped pacing and turned to face the assembly.

'It was then that I recalled Professor Thripp's explanation of how the machine acquires its knowledge. Unlike a clock or a steam engine, whose behaviour is determined solely by its physical construction, this machine's behaviour is shaped by something far more ephemeral: the arrangement of holes punched into thousands upon thousands of cards. The tubes and valves are merely the vessel. The true essence of the machine—its knowledge, its patterns of association, its capacity to produce coherent responses—resides in those holes.'

He moved to the rear of the machine, where the large wooden boxes stood.

'I realised, therefore, that if someone wished to tamper with this machine, they need not touch a single valve or tube. They need only alter the cards—or introduce new cards of their own devising. The machine would consume these cards as it consumed all others, incorporating their contents into its web of associations, never knowing that it had been fed a poison.'

Holmes opened one of the boxes and withdrew a card, holding it up for the assembly to see.

'This insight led me to examine the cards themselves with particular care. I am, as some of you may know, a student of small details—the minute variations that most observers overlook but which, to a trained eye, speak volumes. When I examined the demonstration cards—those punched by Professor Thripp himself for the evening's unveiling—and compared them to the knowledge cards punched by Mr. Marsh, I could immediately perceive the differences.'

He picked up a demonstration card and held it beside the first.

'The shape of the holes, gentlemen. The edges. When a card is punched, the tool leaves distinctive marks—variations in pressure, in angle, in the sharpness of the cut. These variations are as individual as handwriting. Professor Thripp's cards showed slight irregularities—not defects, precisely, but the natural variations of a man whose genius lies in conception rather than execution. Mr. Marsh's cards, by contrast, showed clean, precise edges, the product of a steady hand and consistent pressure.'

He returned the first card to the box and withdrew several others, examining them rapidly.

'When I turned my attention to the knowledge cards—the tens of thousands of cards that constitute the machine's learning—I expected to find only Mr. Marsh's distinctive style. After all, Professor Thripp had told me that his assistant had punched nearly all of them.'

Holmes paused, and when he spoke again, his voice carried a note of quiet intensity.

'I did not find what I expected. The vast majority of the cards were indeed Marsh's work—I could recognise his characteristic precision at a glance. But scattered among them, hidden like needles in a haystack, were cards of an entirely different character.'

He held up one such card, turning it slowly in the gaslight.

'These cards were not merely punched by a different hand. They were punched by a different apparatus entirely. The holes were of a subtly different size and shape—differences invisible to a casual observer, but unmistakable to one who knows what to look for. The apparatus that produced them was clearly not the one used by Professor Thripp and Mr. Marsh.'

Holmes looked out at the assembled members, his grey eyes sharp.

'Professor Thripp believed that only one punching apparatus existed—the one he had constructed for his own use. He was wrong. Someone had built a second device, one capable of producing cards compatible with his machine. Someone had manufactured fraudulent knowledge cards and introduced them into the machine's learning corpus, where they would quietly corrupt its outputs without leaving any visible trace. When I later examined the card found with Sir Reginald's body, I was not surprised to discover it had been produced using the same apparatus.'

He returned the cards to the box and closed the lid.

'Upon arriving at Sir Reginald's residence that evening, I was already certain that some manner of scheme was being played—though I confess I was not yet certain of its goals or its ultimate target. The fraudulent cards told me that someone had gone to extraordinary lengths to corrupt Professor Thripp's machine, but to what end? And who might be endangered by whatever design was unfolding?'

Holmes resumed his pacing, his brow furrowed with recollection.

'I found myself particularly concerned for the safety of Professor Thripp and Mr. Marsh—the two men most intimately connected with the machine, and therefore the most likely targets of any malevolence directed at it. The machine's cryptic prophecy weighed upon my mind: "The next shall be the one who asks without understanding." Who could that refer to, if not the men who operated the device daily, posing queries without comprehending what forces they might be unleashing?'

He paused and glanced toward the door through which Lestrade had departed.

'It was for this reason that I did not object when Inspector Lestrade proposed to detain Mr. Marsh for questioning. Indeed, I encouraged him to do so—and suggested that Professor Thripp himself might be a suspect. Lestrade, I knew, would be flattered by my apparent agreement with his deductions.' A ghost of a smile crossed Holmes's features. 'And where, after all, could two men be safer than in the custody of Scotland Yard? Whatever danger threatened them, it could not reach them in a police cell.'

Holmes moved toward the fireplace at the far end of the Green Salon, gazing into its cold grate as though seeing another fire entirely.

'With Thripp and Marsh secured, I turned my attention to examining Sir Reginald's study. I examined every surface, every corner, every inch of carpet with the closest attention. And I found something most interesting.'

He turned back to face the assembly.

'Embedded in the carpet, near the desk where the body had been discovered, I found several tiny specks of paper. So small as to be nearly invisible—the sort of debris that even a careful cleaning might overlook. But to my eye, trained by long experience to notice what others miss, these specks were unmistakable. They were the precise shape and size of the circles punched from cards by a punching apparatus. The detritus, gentlemen, of card manufacture.'

A murmur of interest rippled through the members.

'Furthermore,' Holmes continued, 'deep within the fireplace—beneath the ashes of the fire that had burned that evening—I discovered the remnants of something that had not quite been consumed. Fragments of heavy cardstock, charred but still recognisable, of precisely the dimensions one would expect from cards designed for Professor Thripp's machine.'

Holmes's grey eyes swept the room.

'The implications were clear. A punching apparatus had been operated in that study—operated extensively enough to leave traces of its work upon the carpet, and the spoiled or surplus cards had been burned in the fireplace. This could hardly have occurred without the knowledge and consent of the study's owner. Sir Reginald Blackwood, it seemed, was not the victim of a conspiracy. He was its architect.'

'But Mr. Holmes!' Sir Bartholomew's voice cut through the murmur that had arisen among the members. His whiskers were aquiver with frustration. 'This is all becoming less clear, not more! You speak of fraudulent cards and paper specks in carpets, but what of the machine's response? What does it mean? What is "the pattern that speaks"? What is "necessary consequence"? What does the machine "complete"?' He spread his hands in a gesture of helpless bewilderment. 'We have been wracking our brains trying to decipher that!'

Holmes smiled—a genuine smile, touched with something that might have been appreciation.

'An excellent question, Sir Bartholomew, and one that I confess occupied my thoughts considerably. The message is indeed enigmatic. In fact'—his smile sharpened—'it is almost too enigmatic. Consider: when I asked the machine about my own accomplishments, it produced fluent nonsense—invented cases, a fictitious knighthood, a trained falcon. The nonsense was confident and detailed, as hallucinations often are. But this response? "The Pattern That Speaks." "Necessary Consequence." These phrases are not confident details. They are deliberate obscurities, designed not to inform but to mystify.'

He turned to me, and I felt the weight of his grey gaze.

'Mr. Pennington here confirmed my own suspicion when we spoke this morning. He observed, quite rightly, that the machine's pronouncement sounded less like the output of a reasoning device and more like the utterances of a fortune-teller—vague enough to mean anything, phrased to sound profound. And he noted that the circumstances of the death seemed like something out of a mystery novel. An impossible crime in a locked room, with no apparent cause and no visible perpetrator.'

Holmes began to pace again, his energy quickening.

'These observations struck me as profoundly important. For when I examined the study door—the door that was supposedly locked from within, that had to be broken down to reach the body—I discovered something most instructive. The lock bore no signs of having been forced. But more than that: it bore no signs of having been used at all in recent memory. The mechanism was stiff with disuse. The bolt, when I tested it, moved with the reluctance of metal that has not stirred in a decade. The story of the locked room was a fiction—a fiction maintained by the man who claimed to have broken down the door.'

A sharp intake of breath from somewhere in the assembly.

'And if the locked room was a fiction,' Holmes continued, 'designed to create an impression of impossibility where none existed—then what of the machine's cryptic message? Might it not serve the same purpose?'

He stopped pacing and faced the assembly squarely.

'I put it to you, gentlemen, that the message is meaningless. It was never intended to convey information. Its sole purpose—like the supposedly locked door, like the card clutched in the dead man's hand—was to create bewilderment. To send us chasing phantoms of meaning through a fog of deliberate obscurity. To make us ask "what is the pattern that speaks?" when we should have been asking an entirely different question.'

'But Mr. Holmes,' interjected a member I did not recognise, 'how could they ensure the machine would produce that particular response? Surely the output of such a device cannot be predicted with certainty?'

'An excellent question,' Holmes replied. 'And the answer lies in those fraudulent knowledge cards I discovered among Professor Thripp's collection. Sir Reginald and Mr. Moran did not merely corrupt the machine at random—they corrupted it with purpose. They introduced cards containing specific phrases: "the pattern that speaks," "necessary consequence," "asks without understanding." They associated these phrases, through careful repetition across dozens of cards, with concepts such as "death," "murder," "killed," and "Blackwood." When the machine received a query containing those fatal words, it would inevitably draw upon the poisoned associations and produce the ominous nonsense its creators had prepared. The prophecy was not a prophecy at all—it was a script, planted in advance and waiting to be triggered.'

'Once the prophecy and the locked room are dismissed as meaningless distractions—theatrical devices designed to occupy the mind rather than inform it—the case becomes considerably simpler. We are left with a straightforward set of facts. A man was found dead. A card was found in his hand, connecting him to Professor Thripp's machine. And the police, naturally, focused their attention on those connected to that machine.'

He glanced toward Moran, who stood slumped in the constable's grip.

'Sir Reginald Blackwood and Mr. Moran—for they had to be acting as accomplices—essentially staged a death. Not a real death of Sir Reginald, but a death that would be believed to be his. They found some poor unfortunate—a homeless man, most likely, of similar build and general appearance to Sir Reginald—and they poisoned him.'

Lestrade stirred. 'The police surgeon found no evidence of poison, Mr. Holmes. He examined the body thoroughly.'

'I am sure he did, Inspector. And I am equally sure that his examination was competent by the standards of conventional toxicology.' Holmes's tone was patient but firm. 'However, I have made something of a study of poisons—I published a monograph on the subject some years ago, cataloguing one hundred and forty-seven distinct toxic substances and their effects—and I have learned never to take such assurances at face value. There are poisons that leave no trace detectable by current methods. There are poisons that mimic natural death so perfectly that no analysis could reveal them. There are poisons that act hours or days after ingestion. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.'

He resumed his pacing.

'But this was not merely a staged death. It was a staged death designed to draw attention—prodigious attention—from the police, from the press, from the public at large. A simple death of an industrialist would merit a paragraph in the evening papers and be forgotten next day. But a mysterious murder accompanied by a cryptic prophecy from a mechanical oracle? Murder in a room locked from within, with no apparent cause and no visible perpetrator? That is the stuff of sensation. That is the sort of case that will mystify newspapers for weeks and be remembered for years.'

Holmes stopped and faced the assembly.

'This realisation led me to three questions. First: why? Why go to such extraordinary lengths to make this staged death occupy the public's mind so prodigiously? What purpose could such notoriety serve?'

He held up a second finger.

'Second: Mr. Fairweather himself. He presented himself as a devoted secretary, grief-stricken at the loss of his employer. Yet when I examined the study door—the door he claimed to have broken down in his haste to reach Sir Reginald—I found the lock untouched, its mechanism stiff with disuse. Mr. Fairweather's account, it seemed, was rather more theatrical than accurate.'

A third finger joined the others.

'And third—the question that must by now be foremost in all your minds—where is the real Sir Reginald Blackwood? If the man who died in that study was not Sir Reginald, then Sir Reginald must be somewhere. And wherever he is hiding, the sooner he is apprehended, the safer everyone connected with this case will be. A man who has already orchestrated one death will not hesitate to orchestrate another if he believes it necessary to achieve his goals.'

Holmes permitted himself a slight smile.

'That last question, as it happens, was the easiest to answer. I have at my disposal a veritable army of informers—the street children of London, the urchins and crossing-sweepers and errand-boys who see everything and are seen by no one. They are more informed of the comings and goings, the happenings and transactions of this great city, than Scotland Yard could ever dream of being.'

A few chuckles rippled through the assembly. Lestrade's expression suggested he did not find the comparison amusing.

'Indeed, their collective body of knowledge might well compete with the contents of Professor Thripp's knowledge cards. Though I confess their information is rather more current, and rather less likely to recommend Mrs. Beeton's recipe for boiled mutton.'

'I put the question to my young associates yesterday evening,' Holmes continued, 'and had an answer within a few hours. A man matching Sir Reginald's appearance—his height, his build, his distinctive grey whiskers—was observed leaving his residence in the morning, long before his "death" was discovered. He proceeded by cab to Victoria Station, where he checked his luggage and boarded a train for Brighton.'

Holmes began to pace again, his energy quickening as he approached the climax of his narrative.

'One of my more resourceful urchins happened to be acquainted with a clerk at the station's luggage office—a friendship cemented, I believe, by the occasional sharing of meat pies. He persuaded his friend to peruse the records. The luggage had been checked under the name of Jonathan Cavendish and was directed to the Grand Metropolitan Hotel in Brighton.'

He stopped and spread his hands.

'One question answered. Sir Reginald Blackwood, very much alive, had fled to Brighton under an assumed name, leaving behind a corpse that the world would believe to be his own.'

Holmes turned to face the reasoning machine, regarding it with an expression that mingled respect with something like amusement.

'The second question—the true identity of Mr. Fairweather—required a different approach. I found myself contemplating: here was a machine designed to retrieve and synthesise information from a vast corpus of human knowledge, including three years of *The Times*. If Mr. Fairweather—or whatever his true name might be—had made any impression upon the newspapers of Europe, might not the machine itself be able to identify him?'

Holmes glanced toward the slumped figure of Moran.

'And Mr. Fairweather, for all his chameleon talents, possesses one feature that is distinctly his own: a set of small parallel scars upon the left ear, the result, I suppose, of a childhood encounter with a sharp-tempered cat. It is the sort of detail that might escape casual notice but would certainly be recorded in any thorough police description.'

I could not help myself. 'Mr. Holmes—the question you asked Mr. Fairweather last night, about acquiring a cat. Was that somehow related to these scars?'

Holmes smiled. 'It was indeed, Mr. Pennington, though not through any chain of logical deduction.' He began to pace slowly, his hands clasped behind his back. 'Mr. Fairweather's involvement in this matter was attested eloquently enough by the condition of the door. However, I wanted to assess what sort of man he was. How skilled was he at controlling his reactions and keeping an artificial composure? To test this, I decided to ask him a question entirely unexpected—something designed to catch him off guard. A person whose manner is natural and unaffected will show visible confusion when confronted with a non sequitur. He might frown, or laugh, or ask what on earth you mean. But a master of wearing a mask will suppress such responses. The mask remains in place even when the question makes no sense.'

He paused in his pacing. 'The scars upon his ear suggested cats as a subject, though any unexpected topic would have served just as well. I grant you, this is not the sort of test one finds in treatises on criminal investigation. It is more intuition than deduction, more art than science. But I have found such tests instructive nonetheless.'

'And what did Mr. Fairweather's reaction tell you?'

'That he was indeed wearing a mask—and wearing it very well. When I asked whether he would recommend cats as companions, there was no confusion, no surprise, no natural human bewilderment at such an odd question in the midst of a murder investigation. His composure never wavered. He simply produced a smooth answer—that he was not fond of cats himself—without ever betraying any sense that the question was peculiar. Only for a fraction of a second did something flicker behind his eyes, something calculating, before the helpful mask settled back into place.'

He turned back to the assembly.

'I proceeded to Scotland Yard, where I prevailed upon certain connexions to grant me a private interview with Professor Thripp. I explained my requirements, and the Professor—despite his distress at his circumstances—was eager to assist. He provided me with detailed instructions for operating the punching apparatus, and specified exactly how to encode a query listing the precise physical description of Mr. Fairweather: his height, his colouring, his build, his manner of dress, and of course, the telltale scar upon his left ear.'

Holmes gestured toward the punching device on the workbench.

'This morning, I followed those instructions to produce the query card myself, then fed it into the apparatus. And the machine, operating precisely as Professor Thripp had designed it, sifted through its vast store of knowledge cards and produced a response.'

A thin smile crossed his angular features.

'The response was quite lengthy, Mr. Pennington. You observed that yourself. It contained a comprehensive account of Mr. Charles Moran's criminal career—every fraud, every confidence scheme, every narrow escape from justice across a dozen European cities. The Rotterdam diamond switch. The Marseilles inheritance affair. The business with the Austrian countess. All of it extracted from newspaper reports the machine had dutifully absorbed during its learning. A catalogue of villainy long and illustrious enough to fill a library of crime fiction.'

He looked toward Moran, who had gone very still.

'The machine, you see, is not capable of clairvoyance. It cannot tell us who killed Sir Reginald Blackwood, because the machine has no knowledge of events that have not been recorded in its learning corpus. But ask it about matters that *are* contained in the newspapers it has consumed, and it performs admirably. It told me exactly who Mr. Fairweather truly was—and armed with that knowledge, the rest of the puzzle fell into place.'

Holmes paused, allowing the assembly to absorb what he had revealed thus far.

'The final question remains: why did Sir Reginald's purported death have to be so sensational? Why the cryptic prophecy, the locked room, the mysterious card clutched in the dead man's hand? Why not simply disappear, or stage a quiet accident that would attract no particular attention?'

He turned to face the members directly.

'This, gentlemen, is a matter of human nature—and once again, the same principle applies. Directing attention prodigiously toward one matter draws it away from another. The more we puzzled over the machine's pronouncement, the less we thought to examine the mundane details of Sir Reginald's affairs. The more the newspapers speculated about impossible crimes, the less they investigated the finances of the deceased.'

Holmes resumed his pacing, his voice taking on the measured tone of a lecturer approaching his conclusion.

'I made certain enquiries this morning with connexions of mine in business circles—men who make it their profession to know the financial standing of prominent industrialists. What I discovered was illuminating. First: Sir Reginald Blackwood, for all his outward prosperity, had been struggling with creditors for some time. His income of late had not kept pace with his expenses. The funding of Professor Thripp's machine, I suspect, was merely the latest in a series of speculative ventures that failed to produce the returns he had anticipated.'

He glanced toward Moran.

'Second—and here Mr. Moran's particular talents become relevant—a number of substantial life insurance policies had been taken out in recent months. These policies were held not by Sir Reginald directly, but by certain business ventures linked through a complicated chain of ownership to none other than Mr. Charles Fairweather.' Holmes permitted himself a thin smile. 'The Conjuror's specialty, after all, is making things appear to be what they are not—including, it would seem, the beneficiaries of insurance contracts.'

He stopped pacing and faced the assembly.

'A simple, unremarkable death—a fall from a horse, a sudden illness—would likely prompt questions. Insurance investigators are suspicious by nature and thorough by training. They would examine the policies, trace the ownership of the beneficiary companies, and eventually discover the connexion. The claim would be denied, and the scheme would collapse.'

Holmes's grey eyes swept the room.

'But a death that captures the public imagination? A death surrounded by mystery and sensation, investigated by Sherlock Holmes himself, reported in every newspaper in England? That is a death no insurance company would dare to question. The more notorious the case, the more thoroughly "proven" Sir Reginald's death becomes in the public mind. To suggest that he might still be alive would seem not merely improbable, but absurd.'

He spread his hands.

'And so, gentlemen, we have our answer. Sir Reginald Blackwood staged his own death, with Mr. Moran's expert assistance, in order to escape his creditors and collect upon fraudulent insurance policies. The reasoning machine, the cryptic prophecy, the locked room—all of it was theatre, designed to create a spectacle so memorable that no one would think to look behind the curtain.'

Sir Bartholomew raised a hand, his whiskers still aquiver with the effort of absorbing so much in so short a time. 'But Mr. Holmes—if Sir Reginald was already struggling with creditors, why did he invest so heavily in building Professor Thripp's machine in the first place? Ten thousand pounds is no trifling sum. Surely that expenditure contributed to—perhaps even caused—his financial ruin?'

'An astute question, Sir Bartholomew.' Holmes nodded approvingly. 'And here I must confess that I am venturing into the realm of supposition rather than demonstrated fact. But I believe Sir Reginald's motives for funding the machine were not as pure as what he told Professor Thripp.'

He began to pace once more, his hands clasped behind his back.

'Sir Reginald has demonstrated, through his actions, considerable capability as a criminal mastermind. The elaborate staging of his death, the collaboration with a professional confidence trickster, the complex web of insurance fraud—these are not the works of a philanthropist. And the machine itself has demonstrated, for all its shortcomings, remarkable power as an investigative tool. Consider: I used it this very morning to identify Mr. Moran from nothing more than a physical description. It sifted through years of newspaper reports and produced a comprehensive dossier of his criminal career.'

Holmes stopped and turned to face the assembly.

'Now imagine such a tool in the hands of a man with fewer scruples than myself. A man who wished to identify vulnerabilities, to research potential victims, to uncover secrets that might be exploited for blackmail or fraud. The machine cannot reason, but it can retrieve and synthesise information on a scale no human could match. I suspect Sir Reginald saw in Professor Thripp's invention not a boon to humanity, but a powerful instrument for his own designs.'

He glanced toward the machine, his expression thoughtful.

'However, once Sir Reginald realised that his funds were running low—that the machine had consumed his fortune without yet producing returns—he was forced to change his plans. The machine could no longer serve as a future tool for his schemes. Instead, it would serve as a theatrical attribute for one final, spectacular fraud: the staging of his own death. The very notoriety that would have made the machine valuable to a criminal became, in the end, merely a means of making his demise unforgettable.'

Holmes spread his hands.

'But this, as I say, is supposition. I do not precisely know Sir Reginald's true intentions. What we know with certainty is that the machine was corrupted, a murder was staged, and two conspirators attempted to profit from the chaos they had created. The rest is speculation—entertaining, perhaps, but ultimately unprovable.'

A harsh laugh cut through the room. All eyes turned to Moran, who had stirred from his deflated stupor. The constable tightened his grip, but the man made no move to escape. Instead, he raised his head, and I saw that his handsome features had twisted into something bitter and sardonic.

'Unprovable,' he repeated. 'How modest of you, Mr. Holmes. How delightfully modest.' He laughed again, a sound entirely devoid of warmth. 'You want to know Sir Reginald's true intentions? I'll tell you his true intentions, since the game is up regardless.'

He straightened in the constable's grip, and for a moment I glimpsed the charisma that must have made him such an effective confidence trickster—the ability to command attention, to hold a room in his palm.

'Sir Reginald came to me four years ago with a proposition. He had discovered Professor Thripp's early work and seen its potential—not for the betterment of humanity, as he told that naive fool, but for blackmail on an industrial scale. Imagine a machine that could sift through every newspaper, every public record, every scrap of printed gossip, and extract the secrets men would pay fortunes to keep hidden. That was his vision. That was what he was building.'

Moran's lip curled.

'But the machine ate money faster than Sir Reginald could feed it. His investments soured. His creditors circled. And so the grand scheme became a smaller one—a mere insurance fraud, dressed up in theatrical nonsense to distract the police.' He shot a venomous glance toward the silent reasoning machine. 'Ten thousand pounds and four years of planning, reduced to a parlour trick. Sir Reginald always did think too highly of his own cleverness.'

'And yet you went along with it,' Holmes observed mildly.

'I was promised a substantial share of the insurance proceeds. Enough to retire from the profession and live comfortably abroad.' Moran's voice dripped with contempt. 'Instead, I am standing here in handcuffs. Tell me, Inspector—when your constables drag him back to London, will you be sure to mention that it was his own secretary who confirmed every detail of his scheme? I should hate for him to think I remained loyal.'

'Oh, I'll make sure he knows,' Lestrade said grimly.

Moran slumped back into the constable's grip, the brief flame of defiance extinguished. 'Do that,' he muttered. 'Do that.'

Holmes regarded him for a moment, then turned back to face the assembly.

'I believe, gentlemen, that you now have sufficient understanding of what transpired in this salon last night. A fraud was perpetrated, a man was murdered, and a remarkable machine was corrupted to serve as an instrument of deception. The conspirators have been identified, and justice—such as it is—will take its course.'

A profound silence settled over the Green Salon. The members of the Chloratic Society sat motionless in their chairs, their faces reflecting the weight of all they had heard. Even Lestrade, who had surely witnessed more than his share of criminal revelations, seemed momentarily lost in thought. The only sound was the faint hiss of the reasoning machine, still warm from Holmes's experiment that morning.

It was Sir Bartholomew who finally broke the silence, his voice subdued.

'And what is to be done with the machine, Mr. Holmes? After all that has happened—the corruption, the false prophecy, the role it played in this dreadful affair—can it ever be trusted again?'

Holmes considered the question carefully before responding.

'That, Sir Bartholomew, is not for me to decide. The machine belongs to Professor Thripp, and it is he who must determine its fate.' He paused, his grey eyes resting upon the apparatus with an expression that was difficult to read. 'For my own part, I should admit that I was somewhat sceptical at the outset—particularly after the machine regaled me with tales of my supposed knighthood and my trained falcon.'

A few nervous chuckles rippled through the assembly.

'But having now witnessed its capabilities more fully,' Holmes continued, 'I see tremendous potential in a device of this nature—in the right hands.' He emphasised these last words with a slight hardening of his tone.

He moved toward the door, retrieving his hat from where it had been set aside.

'I hope that Professor Thripp will find the means to continue his work—and that he will find patrons whose motives are rather more honourable than Sir Reginald's proved to be. The reasoning machine, for all its limitations, represents something genuinely new in the world. It would be a shame to see it abandoned because of the villainy of others.'

Holmes paused at the threshold and turned to address the assembly one final time.

'Gentlemen of the Chloratic Society, I thank you for your hospitality and your patience. I wish you every success in your future chloratic endeavours—whatever those may entail.' A ghost of a smile crossed his angular features. 'And I trust that your next scientific demonstration will prove rather less eventful than this one.'

With that, he departed, leaving behind a room full of bewildered gentlemen, one deflated confidence trickster, and a steam-powered reasoning machine that hissed softly to itself, as though contemplating what strange new knowledge might next be fed into its seven hundred and forty-two brass chambers.

## EPILOGUE

*In Which Loose Ends Are Tidied and the Future Remains Pleasantly Uncertain*

Several months have now passed since the extraordinary events I have here recorded, and I find myself compelled to add a few words regarding their aftermath—if only to satisfy those readers who, like myself, prefer their narratives to conclude with some sense of completion.

For a time, the newspapers were abuzz with rumours of a mysterious affair involving the late Sir Reginald Blackwood—or rather, the not-so-late Sir Reginald Blackwood—and what the more sensational papers insisted on calling "the Mechanical Prophet of Pall Mall." The Daily Chronicle devoted three consecutive editions to increasingly fanciful speculation, while the Illustrated Police News produced an engraving that bore no resemblance whatsoever to either the reasoning machine or the Chloratic Society Club, but which sold a great many copies nonetheless. Throughout this storm of publicity, credit for the brilliant unravelling of the conspiracy was attributed almost exclusively to Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, a circumstance that Holmes observed with what I can only describe as amused indifference.

The Club itself weathered the attention with characteristic dignity. Our porter fended off inquisitive reporters with his usual comportment—which is to say, he began bowing them out of the vestibule and had generally completed the gesture by the time they lost patience and departed of their own accord. Sir Bartholomew, displaying unexpected reserves of diplomatic cunning, managed to keep the names of individual Club members entirely out of the public prints, a feat he accomplished through judicious application of his connexions in Fleet Street and what I suspect was a not-inconsiderable quantity of excellent claret.

Sir Reginald Blackwood and Mr. Charles Moran were both tried and convicted—Blackwood for fraud, conspiracy, and accessory to murder; Moran for fraud, conspiracy, and the murder itself, he having administered the fatal poison. Blackwood received fifteen years; Moran, given the more direct nature of his involvement in the death of that poor unnamed vagrant, was sentenced to hang.

As for Professor Thripp, I regret to report that he has thus far been unable to secure a new patron for his work. The notoriety of the affair brought his invention to public attention in a manner that has made potential sponsors understandably cautious. No one, it seems, wishes to appear as the next Sir Reginald Blackwood—at least not publicly.

The reasoning machine itself now resides in crates in the Professor's modest residence in Clerkenwell, where it occupies most of the parlour and a not-insignificant portion of the hallway. I visited him there last month and found him in surprisingly good spirits. He has, it appears, cooled somewhat in his enthusiasm for this particular machine—viewing it now as a first attempt, a preliminary sketch for something greater.

'Steam, you see, Mr. Pennington,' he explained, gesturing with a half-eaten biscuit in a manner that sent crumbs cascading onto his waistcoat, 'steam has inherent limitations. The boiler, the pressure, the perpetual risk of explosion—and the coal fumes, Mr. Pennington! The soot! I have spent three years breathing coal dust, and no laundering will ever cleanse the evidence.'

He has lately been speculating about the possibility of a similar device based on galvanic principles—voltaic power rather than steam. He explains tirelessly to anyone who will listen the advantages of such an approach: no coal fumes, no steam, no risk of scalding, and—he emphasises this point with particular fervour—absolutely no lingering dampness in the upholstery.

'Imagine it, Mr. Pennington! Clean, silent, instantaneous! The galvanic impulse travels through wire as thought travels through the mind—without friction, without combustion, without the perpetual anxiety of maintaining proper boiler pressure!'

He has made a few preliminary attempts at constructing such a device, and has shown me diagrams of bewildering complexity involving batteries, coils, and something he calls "resistance gates" that would serve the same function as the steam valves in his original design. But he laments that the galvanic technology of the present age is far behind that of steam.

'The principles are sound,' he assured me, his spectacles glinting with reflected enthusiasm, 'but the practical implementation eludes us. We lack voltaic cells that will hold their charge, lines that will not waste the current, and commutators that will answer without delay or irritable sparking. Perhaps in fifty years, Mr. Pennington. Perhaps in a hundred. Someone will build it, I am certain—but I fear it will not be me.'

I left him surrounded by his crates and his diagrams, still muttering about galvanic potentials and conductor arrays, and reflected that some men are simply born before their proper time.

With sponsorship withdrawn, Mr. Edwin Marsh found himself without employment. He bore this reversal with the same placid equanimity he had displayed throughout the entire affair. Sir Bartholomew, feeling perhaps some residual guilt for having recommended Marsh to Thripp in the first place, took it upon himself to secure the young man a new position. Marsh is currently employed as a junior clerk at Grimsby, Pallister & Hodge, a firm in Cheapside that concerns itself with maritime insurance documentation. It is, by all accounts, work of stupefying tedium, involving the meticulous copying of cargo manifests and the cross-referencing of shipping schedules. Marsh, I am told, performs his duties with the same mechanical precision he once applied to the punching of knowledge cards. I am not entirely sure he has noticed the change.

I have, in the intervening months, made the acquaintance of Dr. John Watson, Holmes's celebrated companion and chronicler, who had been holidaying in the West Country during the events described in these pages. He returned to find Holmes unusually communicative about the case—a circumstance Watson attributed to the novel involvement of a reasoning machine, which had apparently captured Holmes's imagination in a way that common murders rarely did.

Watson proved to be quite a likeable fellow—warm, sincere, possessed of an easy manner that puts one immediately at ease. He is perhaps a little too straightlaced for the more eccentric membership of the Chloratic Society, and I confess he displayed no particular interest in chloratic matters when I attempted to explain them. But we have dined together on several occasions, and I find his company most agreeable. It was Watson, in fact, who suggested that I write up the affair of the reasoning machine for publication—arguing that the world ought to know of this remarkable case. He has provided invaluable feedback on the drafts of the present work, gently correcting my tendency toward excessive digression and encouraging me to trust that the events themselves are sufficiently extraordinary without embellishment.

Holmes himself was made a lifetime honorary member of the Chloratic Society, a distinction proposed by Sir Bartholomew at a special meeting of the membership committee and approved by unanimous acclamation. When Sir Bartholomew presented him with the certificate, Holmes examined it with the same close attention he might give to a ransom note.

'Most handsome,' he said at last. 'I note that it does not specify what duties are expected of a lifetime honorary member. I trust this implies I am not required to hold opinions about municipal drainage.'

He does drop by the Club occasionally—more often, I suspect, than his protestations of indifference would suggest. I have noticed that his visits tend to coincide with Professor Thripp's own appearances at the Club, and I have observed the two of them in quiet conversation on more than one occasion, their heads bent together over diagrams or calculations. I suspect Holmes is genuinely interested to know if there are any developments in Thripp's efforts at mechanical reasoning.

I still have not found the occasion to ask Holmes whether he has, in fact, acquired a falcon.

THE END
