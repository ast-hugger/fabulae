# The Arrangement of Lunch

The table is rectangular. Its surface is black lacquer, or something made to resemble black lacquer, and reflects, in a band of distortion running lengthwise down its center, the two cylindrical paper lanterns suspended from the ceiling. Between these reflected shapes—not quite ellipses—a smaller, brighter point of light, whose source is not immediately apparent.

On the wall opposite, between the second and third niches, there is a painting. It hangs at a height of approximately one hundred forty centimeters, measured from the floor to the lower edge of the frame. The frame is thin, dark wood—nearly the same color as the lacquer of the table—and encloses a rectangular image, wider than it is tall, perhaps fifty centimeters by thirty-five. The painting depicts an interior: a room, rendered in muted tones—ochre, gray-green, the dull brown of unglazed ceramic. In the center of the composition, a low table. On the table, a teapot. On either side of the table, a figure: a man on the left, a woman on the right.

There is no one sitting at the near placemat. A man is sitting behind the far placemat. His right hand rests on the table near the teapot, the fingers slightly curled, though whether this represents a hand at rest or a hand that has just released the handle is ambiguous. His left hand is flat on the table, fingers slightly spread. A teapot sits between the two placemats, brown stoneware, unglazed, with a bamboo handle arching over its top. Or the handle is a curve of darker pigment against the body of the pot, applied in a single confident stroke. The teapot occupies the exact center of the table.

Steam rises from the spout. It curves to the right in a thin wisp that dissipates after approximately five centimeters, or it curves to the right in a single stroke of thinned white paint that fades into the background, which is a wall of horizontal lines—the slats of a screen, or reeds, or the grooves between strips of pale wood paneling. The lid sits slightly askew, leaving a crescent-shaped gap on one side.

A woman enters. There is a brief intrusion of street noise—a bus, or something with the weight of a bus—before the door closes. She walks between the two rows of tables and stops at the near side of the rectangular table. She says something. The man says something. She sits down.

The woman has always been seated. Her posture has not changed: the straight back, the slight forward inclination of the head, as though attending to something the man has said, or as though examining the teapot between them. Her hands are in her lap, or at her sides, or on either side of the placemat, symmetrical.

Now there are two people at the table. There have always been two people at the table.

The walls are paneled in strips of pale wood, each approximately ten centimeters across, separated by grooves of one or two millimeters. These vertical lines find their counterpart in the horizontal lines of the wall behind the two figures—the screen or reeds—so that the two sets of lines form a grid, each perpendicular to the other, intersecting at the surface where the frame holds its rectangle of ochre and gray-green against the pale wood.

In the first niche, the teapot has no lid. The teapot on the table has a lid, a dark disc resting in the circular opening with a small knob at its center. There are three teapots. Or two and a painting of a third. Or one teapot, described from three distances.

Two cups without handles sit on either side of the teapot, glazed in a mottled gray-green. Or they are two lighter shapes, not distinctly rendered, that might be cups or might be folds in a cloth or shadows cast by the teapot under a light that enters from the upper left at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees. The man reaches for his cup. He turns it a quarter rotation and sets it down. The wet ring it leaves on the surface is not a perfect circle but an interrupted arc. He picks it up and drinks. He sets it down again, producing a complete ring that overlaps the previous ring, creating a shape resembling a figure eight. There is only one ring. There are several, their order impossible to reconstruct. There are none: the table's surface does not retain such marks, or the light is insufficient to reveal them, or the man has not yet lifted his cup.

The woman picks up the chopsticks in their paper sleeve, examines them, turns the sleeve over once, and sets them down. She has already separated them. She is holding a piece of sushi between them, rotating the fish side downward. She places it in her mouth and chews slowly, looking at the wooden board or at the space where the piece had been—a faint rectangle of moisture on the blond wood. There is no wooden board. There are no chopsticks. The woman's hands remain where they have always been, the ochre of her garment blending into the ochre of the mat on which she sits so that the boundary between figure and ground is almost entirely dissolved. Six pieces of sushi remain on the board. Or two, possibly three. A grain of rice has come loose and lies on the wood like a small white stone.

A laminated menu lies on the table. The woman opens it. Photographs of dishes are arranged in a grid, their colors saturated: the orange of salmon, the green of a garnish, the white of rice so bright it seems corrected after the fact. These colors bear no relation to the other palette, which contains no orange, no bright green, no white brighter than the steam-stroke above the spout: ochre, gray-green, the dull brown of unglazed ceramic.

She taps a photograph. The man leans forward. She taps another. She closes the menu.

His hand closes around the handle. He lifts the pot and pours into the cup nearest the woman. The stream is thin and pale—a yellow so faint it is almost colorless, with a greenish cast that becomes apparent as the cup fills. A single drop falls from the spout and strikes the table, forming a small dark circle. This dark circle has its equivalent near the base of the teapot—a mark that might be a drop of spilled tea, or a flaw in the surface, or a deliberate element meant to anchor the teapot to the table, a shadow no larger than a fingertip. He pours into the second cup. The stream wavers. A line of tea crosses the rim and runs down the outer surface, following the contour of the glaze to the base, where it pools.

The man's fingers are curled near the handle. Between this gesture and the act of pouring there is no interval, or the interval is the width of the wall on which the frame hangs, or the interval does not exist because they are the same gesture observed from two distances, one measured in centimeters of lacquer and one in centimeters of brushstroke.

Plates are on the table. Each holds a mound of rice and three pieces of something fried, golden, with small bubbles in the crust, beside a heap of shredded cabbage with a wedge of lemon. The lemon is cut cleanly, its cross-section a radiating geometry. The plates have not arrived. The waitress is walking toward the counter. Nothing has been served. Nothing is being eaten. The teapot sits between the two figures on a table in a room whose walls are a screen of horizontal lines, in a light that enters from the upper left and will not move. Or the walls are vertical strips of pale wood, and the light comes from two cylindrical paper lanterns, and the waitress is returning with a black tray.

The man is speaking. His index finger traces a horizontal line in the air above the table, underlining an invisible word. The woman listens, her head tilted to the right by a few degrees. Her left hand rises and touches the area just below her left ear, then returns. The man's head is turned toward the woman, or toward the teapot, the angle ambiguous—a difference of perhaps five degrees. The woman's head, with its slight forward inclination, might be directed at the man or at the table. The space between them—the width of the table, the width of the teapot—is the gap across which all utterances must travel, all gestures must be performed, all tea must be poured and received.

She speaks. Her right hand lifts and makes a gesture—fingers closing and opening, releasing something invisible, illustrating dispersal. He says something brief. She pauses, resumes. Her hands have not moved. They remain where they have always been, rendered in the same ochre that renders her garment and the mat.

The man picks up his cup of tea with both hands. He brings it below his chin for a moment and drinks without looking away from the woman's face. He replaces the cup. A small bowl of miso soup is on the table, its surface opaque, pale brown, with cubes of tofu below the surface and strands of seaweed near the rim. The woman lifts it and drinks. The tofu cubes shift. A drop remains on her lower lip, then disappears.

The man squeezes the lemon wedge over the fried items. A seed falls. He picks it up with the tips of his chopsticks—closing on the small, wet, ovoid shape—and places it on the rim of the plate. The fingertips curving around the absent handle, the chopstick tips closing on the seed: each a study in the narrowing of attention to an object no larger than a centimeter, held briefly, then released.

The round stone in the second niche has not moved. It is gray, with a single vein of white mineral at an oblique angle. Its surface reflects nothing. It occupies the niche completely, touching the back wall and both sides, as though placed not for display but to fill the opening exactly.

The pickled ginger has been partially consumed. The wasabi cone has dried at its peak, the matte surface contrasting with the moist green of its base. Sushi pieces remain on the board. The man reaches for the last piece. The woman reaches at the same moment. Their chopsticks converge. One pair withdraws. He takes the piece, holds it, places it on her plate. She eats it without soy sauce. There are no chopsticks. The hands have not moved. The teapot sits between them, its steam permanently curving to the right, its shadow permanently dark at its base, the two figures permanently inclined toward one another across the narrow width of the table.

Outside, through the glass partition, the street continues. A siren rises and falls in its two-note pattern. Something metallic taps in a staccato rhythm. A voice, amplified and distorted, compresses its words into rhythm without content.

None of this penetrates. The room exists in silence, or in whatever sound is supplied: the pour of liquid, the rustle of fabric, the creak of wood, the nothing that is the sound of two people sitting across from one another at a table where nothing will happen because everything has already happened and been fixed in pigment.

A bill rests on the table, a slip of white paper face-down on a small black tray. Neither of them has turned it over. The man is speaking, his right hand making the same horizontal gesture—the invisible underline—and the woman is watching his hand, or the space it moves through. There is no bill. The food has not arrived. The woman is entering from the direction of the entrance. The woman has always been seated. The man holds a cup of tea. The man's hand rests near the teapot, fingers curled. A drop of condensation traces a line down the cup's outer surface, or a drop of spilled tea traces a line down the cup's glaze, or a stroke of thinned pigment traces a line from the spout into the air and fades.

The table is rectangular. Its surface is black lacquer, or ochre, or the dull brown of unglazed ceramic, or something made to resemble any of these. On the wall, the frame holds its rectangle. On the table, the teapot holds its steam. Between the man and the woman—whichever man, whichever woman—the narrow width persists: of the table, of the frame, of the distance across which a cup of tea is poured and received, the liquid falling in a pale arc from spout to vessel, in a room whose walls are vertical lines or horizontal lines, in a light that comes from paper lanterns or from the upper left corner of a painted sky that is not a sky but a wash of ochre through which, faintly, the grain of the surface shows.
