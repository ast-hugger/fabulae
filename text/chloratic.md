# **The Chloratic Society Club**

_A Wellsian-style description_

The **Chloratic Society Club**, a tall, soot-dusted structure squeezed somewhat apologetically between a piano warehouse and the offices of the _Bimetallic Review_, stands at the quieter end of Pall Mall. A casual passer-by might mistake it for any other London edifice where elderly clerks perpetually adjust ledgers; only the faint glimmer of green glass in the vestibule lamps hints at its particular character.

Inside, the club is a narrow and lamplit kingdom of **respectable oddities**. The entrance hall smells faintly of Russia leather and pipe ash, as though the carpets have absorbed a century’s worth of Victorian anxieties. A member entering at dusk—preferably with the collar of his greatcoat turned up—receives from the porter a solemn bow of such geological slowness that it suggests the movement of sedimentary strata rather than a human neck.

The members pride themselves on being **men of chloratic temperament**—a phrase that, while scientifically meaningless, carries an air of intellectual exclusivity. In practical terms, it means the members are either mildly pale of complexion, excessively fond of botanical pursuits, or merely willing to pay the fees.

The reading room, with its green-shaded lamps and deep, amphibian hush, contains newspapers from every continental capital, many of which remain unread for weeks on end except by one elderly barrister who has privately vowed to outlive the Ottoman Empire and checks its obituary daily. The smoking room is a perpetual fogbank of Latakia and earnest, muddled talk about municipal drainage. The club’s **Green Salon**, a smaller chamber overlooking a courtyard of captive plane trees, is reserved for the discussion of scientific matters, although the science tends to be of a speculative, Wellsian sort—martian canals, anti-gravity notions, and peculiar machines that a member is “quite certain will revolutionise omnibus propulsion, if only the authorities would take him seriously.”

# **The St. Alban’s Vigilance Club**

_A Conan Doyle–style description_

Directly facing the dim green lamps of the Chloratic Society stands a building of quite another character—broad-fronted, dignified, and touched here and there by the discreet burnish of good brass. This is the **St. Alban’s Vigilance Club**, an institution of no small repute among military men, colonial officials, and those civil servants who have made a trade of keeping a steady hand where the Empire’s arm grows thin.

The façade is severe but not unfriendly: tall windows, polished until they hold the lamplight like still water; two stone lions, discreetly weathered, flanking the steps; and above them, the club’s crest—a lantern with a watchful eye at its centre. In the dusk it glows faintly, as if in reassurance that the sentry never sleeps.

Within, the **hall porter** is a man of such upright carriage that one instinctively straightens his own shoulders upon entering. The great hall has an air of order and tempered vigour: umbrellas precisely arranged, newspapers squared upon their tables, and the footfalls of members softened by thick Turkish carpets of sober pattern.

The St. Alban’s Vigilance Club, though not the oldest nor the largest in London, possesses a character immediately recognisable to any man accustomed to purposeful company. In the **Smoking Gallery**, one may hear low talk of frontier provinces, mining concessions, railway charters, and the latest cleverness of some foreign ministry. No bravado is tolerated here, though a dry humour—usually military in origin—finds ready purchase.

The **Reading Room**, with its tall windows overlooking Pall Mall, is a handsome apartment of dark woods and brass fittings. There is almost always a man in uniform seated at the long central table, his tunic immaculate, his brow furrowed over the _Times_ or _Army and Navy Gazette_. A pair of Persian firearms, captured in some long-past affair, hang above the mantelpiece, silently reminding the reader that the world is larger than London’s fog-bound streets.

The club’s **Vigilant Lounge**, so named for its tradition of late-hours conversation, is well known among its members as the scene of many quietly decisive meetings: a young officer dispatched to an obscure but necessary post; a civil engineer entrusted with surveys in a distant territory; a discreet whisper that some rising crisis “might be managed” by the right man in the right place.

# **The So-Called Green Lamp Disturbance**

_From the private notes of Mr. Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society Club_

It would be quite unfair, I think, to say that the Chloratic Society is a frivolous institution. We are men of pale but earnest disposition, inclined more to reflection than to any form of rowdiness. Indeed, I cannot remember an occasion in which a raised voice disturbed the greenish tranquillity of our Reading Room, save the infamous afternoon when Mr. Blenkinsop discovered—incorrectly—that the _Illustrated London News_ had been mislaid.

It was therefore with some shock that I found our vestibule on the afternoon of the twentieth in a state of what may only be described as *scientific disarray*.

I had just finished luncheon—cold beef, an apologetic spoonful of horseradish, and that pleasant, faintly luminescent pudding which our steward insists is quite harmless—when I heard, through the doors, a noise resembling a gunshot muffled by wet flannel. Several gentlemen looked up from their newspapers, and one elderly member behind a plant in the corner gave a species of amphibious croak. Then came the unmistakable sound of feet scurrying in a most unchloratic fashion.

I rose at once, propelled by equal parts curiosity and dread, and stepped into the vestibule. The sight that greeted me was exceedingly odd.

Our junior laboratory assistant—one Wilfred Sugden, a timid youth of blotched complexion and an unfortunate fondness for volatile compounds—was nowhere to be seen, though the faint odour of his working coat lingered in the air. The green vestibule lamp, recently the subject of his private attentions, hung at a queer angle, its internal filament smouldering in a fashion that would have excited Mr. Edison.

On the floor lay a faint trail of chalky dust and, in the doorway, a single boot-mark, as though someone had been struck by an idea or an explosion and set off running before fully deciding which.

I stepped outside.

The fog had adopted that curious greenish tint that always makes our lamps look more impressive than they truly are. Across the street, the St. Alban’s Vigilance Club glowed with its officious barium lantern—a self-satisfied eye peering from its perch like a colonial official inspecting baggage. In the middle of the pavement, however, was a gathering quite unlike the usual sedate flow of Pall Mall.

There, in a huddle of constables and St. Alban’s worthies, lay a man being attended to with all the fussy gravity that the Vigilance Club brings to every matter, from minor injuries to the decanting of port. And there—good heavens—was Sugden himself, unconscious!

Before I could formulate any reasonable interpretation of this tableau, Mr. Wickersby (who had followed me out) remarked, “Something electrical, no doubt. I always suspected that lamp.”

The men from the Vigilance Club, meanwhile, appeared to have adopted a proprietary air toward the collapsed figure, as though he had chosen their pavement through some moral preference rather than sheer misfortune. They displayed him like a captured specimen, which greatly irritated me—not because I valued Sugden particularly, but because the Vigilance Club’s habits of superiority have long been an unhealthy influence upon our street.

At that moment, Sherlock Holmes and his medical companion arrived with the air of men who make a living by plunging into other people’s perplexities. Holmes surveyed the scene, sniffed the air, glanced at our vestibule lamp, and in the space of ten seconds formed more conclusions than most men produce in a year.

I admit that I find Holmes disagreeably efficient. A man ought, in my view, to take a little time to relish a mystery before solving it.

Nonetheless, his explanation—delivered with a clinical briskness that left both clubs blinking—proved regrettably accurate.

Our assistant Sugden, it appears, had been *tampering with the lamp*, likely attempting to reproduce the phosphorescent effect of the Vigilance Club’s barium lantern. Whether this was out of scientific enthusiasm or professional envy I cannot say, though with Sugden one may safely assume a muddled combination of both.

Holmes pointed out the scorch on Sugden’s sleeve, the dust trail, and the nature of the explosion itself, and had the entire affair reconstructed before Wickersby had finished clearing his throat.

The Vigilance men, hearing that their lantern had indirectly caused the rush of an injured man onto _their_ pavement, adopted an expression of pained nobility. They hinted that they had, through their superior vigilance, prevented a greater disaster. A ridiculous claim, for nothing prevents a Chloratic catastrophe more thoroughly than our own innate lethargy.
    
The Chloratic Society, needless to say, bears little responsibility. We encourage scientific curiosity; we do not regulate every flicker of it. If Sugden elected to dabble in barium mimicry without supervision, the blame rests upon the explosive enthusiasm of youth.
## **Afterword**

The next morning, the steward found Sugden awake but incapable of coherent thought, muttering about “luminous superiority.” He has since been advised to take a fortnight’s leave, and the club electrician—whom none of us knew existed until now—has been instructed to replace the lamp entirely.

The Vigilance Club, of course, has behaved as though they heroically intercepted a comet. They sent us a letter expressing “deep concern” and “readiness to assist in preventing further occurrences.” The tone was one of benevolent chastisement. We replied, courteously, that our lamps continue to function with admirable consistency.

In truth, I cannot help but think the entire episode a lesson in the dangers of cross-street illumination rivalry. Yet it has given us, at least, a lively topic for quiet conversation, and for that alone the incident may have been worth the trouble.

# **The Luminous Displacement of Mr. Sugden**

_Being a continuation of the events commonly referred to as the Green Lamp Disturbance_  
_Recorded by Horace Pennington, F.C.S., Chloratic Society_

One would imagine, after the regrettable explosion involving our vestibule lamp and young Sugden’s sudden collapse upon the pavement, that the Chloratic Society might for a time adopt an attitude of scientific restraint. Such an expectation, however, would proceed from a profound misunderstanding of our membership. We took the incident as evidence not of danger but of _progress_—the sort of progress that happens to other people and therefore appears harmless.

Our Committee, in its characteristic tendency toward hopeful ignorance, decided that the best way to prevent further mishaps was to **modernise** the entire system of club illumination. They engaged one Professor Ambrose Leeming, a man of prodigious beard and dubious credentials, whose lectures on “Radiant Essences of the Etheric Medium” had previously been received by us with polite scepticism and mild indigestion.

Leeming assured us that his inventions would usher in a new era of *self-sustaining luminance*—lamps requiring no oil, no gas, and possibly no electricity. “Light,” he said with a dramatic flourish that upset three teaspoons, “shall be your obedient tenant.”

I confess now that, in hindsight, this remark should have alarmed us more than it did.

Within a fortnight the Professor had installed, in our Green Salon, a tall cylindrical apparatus composed of brass, smoked glass, and a series of tiny rotating mirrors that hummed ominously. He called it the **Etheric Lamp**, though it resembled a cross between a lighthouse model and a musical instrument designed by an insomniac.

Its function, according to Leeming, was to draw upon “sub-visible oscillations of the luminiferous ether”—a substance whose existence Holmes has since told me he “never credited for a moment, except as a convenient metaphor.”

Sugden, recently recovered from his earlier explosion, was appointed the device’s custodian. I watched him polish the brass housing with an expression of devotional zeal that did not bode well.

On the evening the machine was first activated, a dozen members gathered around it, murmuring with that mixture of curiosity and dread that characterises most Chloratic scientific sessions. Leeming manipulated several switches, Sugden held his breath, and the mirrors began to spin with a low, insistent whine.

The room brightened. Not in the ordinary way—as though lit by a lamp—but in a manner altogether peculiar. The shadows along the walls *withdrew*, shrinking like timid animals. The air took on a faint vibration, and the objects nearest the machine acquired an outline that trembled slightly, as if impatient to be somewhere else.

“That can’t be right,” said Wickersby, who has always distrusted progress.

But before he could elaborate, *Sugden vanished*.

The disappearance was instantaneous. A shimmer like heated air enveloped him, and then he was simply not present. His polishing cloth fell to the carpet, which struck me as unnecessarily theatrical.

The Professor exclaimed, “He has slipped along the etheric gradient!”

I exclaimed something considerably less technical.

The Green Salon erupted in alarm. A chair overturned itself without assistance; the mirrors on the device spun increasingly fast; and the shadows—those treacherous refugees—began climbing the walls again in slanted, unnatural angles.

“Turn it off!” someone shouted.

“I—I don’t know how!” bleated Leeming.

It was at this most undignified juncture that a knock sounded at the Salon door.

Holmes entered with Dr. Watson behind him, the two figures framed in the doorway like a pair of very calm punctuation marks amidst our grammatical chaos.

“I thought,” Holmes said, “that after your previous experiment you might benefit from a passing look-in. I see I was correct.”

Holmes surveyed the vibrating atmosphere, the trembling shadows, the abandoned polishing cloth. His expression suggested that he had encountered similar strangeness, though perhaps at a slightly lower intensity.

“Mr. Pennington,” he said with perfect composure, “where is your assistant?”

“Displaced!” I managed. “Along an etheric gradient!”

Holmes raised one eyebrow, a gesture which conveyed enough scepticism to fill a monograph. He stepped toward the machine; the air shimmered around him as though considering whether to displace him as well.

Watson pulled me aside. “Is this another lighting accident?”

“This time it is more an _unlighting_ accident.”

Holmes bent over the apparatus. “Hmph. Mirrors oscillating at uneven intervals. Static discharge evident along the brass housing. A faint chemical odour consistent with barium salts. And—good heavens—this lever is set to ‘inversion.’ Why does this machine contain an inversion lever?”

Leeming muttered, “For reasons of symmetry.”

Holmes flicked a switch, then another. The machine growled like an offended cat. Shadows rippled. The atmosphere contracted. And then:

*Sugden reappeared.*

He materialised all at once, looking as startled as a man interrupted in the middle of sneezing. His hair stood out with charged luminosity; one of his sleeves was faintly transparent.

“Where—where was I?” he stammered.

Holmes answered dryly: “Not here.”

Once the room ceased quivering and the machine was shut down (with a hard slap from Holmes), Sugden explained his experience in halting phrases.

He described: a space with *no up or down*, only gradients of brightness, floating shapes like half-remembered furniture, a sensation of being _slightly to the left_ of himself, a “dreadful humming,” which Holmes identified as the mirrors, and, alarmingly, a *second Sugden*—or at least a smudged luminous outline—who appeared to resent his presence
    
Watson declared that Sugden required immediate rest and possibly several meals.

Holmes addressed the Committee with a severity I found both chastening and strangely comforting.

“Gentlemen, you have allowed a dangerously unstable apparatus to be placed in a building full of combustible furniture and credulous men. Whatever Professor Leeming believes he has harnessed, it is not the ether. It is merely a collection of poorly understood electrical discharges interacting with reflective surfaces in unpredictable ways. If this device remains here another hour, I expect either a fire, a total structural collapse, or the multiplication of your assistant into a number most inconvenient for housekeeping.”

This, delivered in Holmes’s firm voice, carried more weight than any Committee vote.

The Etheric Lamp was dismantled that very night. Sugden was given a month’s leave with strict instructions to avoid all mirrors, polished brass, and bright ideas. Professor Leeming vanished from our lives with much less dignity than Sugden had from the Salon.
## **Afterword**

The Chloratic Society continues, of course, in its wholesome pursuit of cautious curiosity. Our lamps are once again ordinary. Our shadows behave themselves. And our Committee now requires that all future scientific demonstrations be reviewed by an external consultant.

Watson has suggested—though I cannot tell whether he is serious—that Holmes be retained in this capacity.

For my part, I should feel safer already.

# **The Perambulating Atmosphere**

_Being an Account of an Ill-Advised Demonstration at the Chloratic Society Club_  
_Recorded by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

In the months since Sherlock Holmes was appointed our _External Consultant for Scientific Prudence_—a title we adopted in lieu of admitting we needed supervision—we Chloratic men have conducted ourselves with what I can only describe as a freshly polished sense of caution. Our lamps were ordinary, our experiments moderate, and our junior assistant Sugden was expressly forbidden to touch anything that buzzed, glowed, or produced odours not previously documented.

It was therefore something of a surprise when our Committee approved Professor Hildebrand Cusp’s proposed demonstration, titled *“The Captured Atmosphere and Its Practical Employment.”*  The title alone should have warned us.

Professor Cusp was a gentleman of considerable forehead and negligible restraint, whose previous inventions included the _Antipodean Barometer_ (which measured weather in places the owner had never visited) and the _Silent Gong_ (which was only useful for announcing things one did not want anyone to hear). His newest apparatus, he assured us, would prove nothing less than the domestication of air.

I confess that my expectations were low. They soon sank much lower.

Holmes and Watson arrived punctually, Holmes with an expression of resigned foreknowledge, Watson with a medical bag of the type one usually associates with battlefields.

“Pennington,” Holmes said the moment he stepped through the door, “where is the exit?”

“Behind you,” I answered.

“Good. I prefer to know it in advance.”

Watson added, “We also recommend clearing any flammable furniture.”

Unfortunately, at the Chloratic Society, _all_ our furniture is flammable—some spectacularly so—so this counsel was impossible to follow.

The device itself stood in the centre of the Green Salon like a brass-and-canvas elephant attempting to balance on a tea-table. It consisted of: a large cylindrical bellows, a network of glass tubes coiling like transparent intestines, a spherical chamber lined with black cloth, and a crank, which Professor Cusp insisted upon calling _“the atmospheric regulator.”_

“It captures air, gentlemen!” Cusp declared.  

“No need,” Holmes murmured, “air is already rather well distributed.”

The Professor ignored him.

“My invention compresses, isolates, and refines the very breath of the room into a more disciplined and portable form—allowing air to be moved, applied, or withdrawn at will!”

Holmes gave the machine a single glance. “It is a pump with delusions of grandeur.”

Cusp turned the crank. The bellows inflated with a sigh, the tubes vibrated delicately, and the black-lined sphere emitted a faint gurgle—as though clearing its throat before reciting a poem it didn’t understand.

The atmosphere in the room changed. Literally.

I do not mean to say it changed in the metaphorical sense—growing tense, excited, or philosophical. No. The *air began to migrate*.

A breeze materialised from the corner near Wickersby’s favourite armchair and proceeded across the room with the purposeful gait of a man late for dinner. Curtains fluttered. Newspapers lifted themselves as though preparing to fly south for winter. A member’s moustache curled inwards.

Watson seized a chair to steady himself. “Holmes, this is dangerously unhealthy! A man cannot remain conscious absent the very medium of respiration!”

“That, Watson,” Holmes said, “is precisely why we shall not remain here.”

The air, now possessed of what I can only describe as a *collective intention*, surged toward the machine. Cusp, delighted, turned the crank faster. This proved unwise.

The bellows expanded beyond what I believed the laws of materials science permitted. Then, with a sound like an embarrassed cough, the entire apparatus began *filling itself*—not with more air, but with *all the air*.

I staggered. Wickersby clutched a drapery. A junior member attempting to fetch his umbrella found himself briefly pinned to the wall by a rude draft. The room dimmed. Matches sputtered. Candles shrank to tiny, gasping flames.

Holmes’s voice cut through the chaos:

“Professor Cusp, cease turning that crank immediately!”

“I cannot!” Cusp wheezed. “The atmospheric gradient has engaged the regulator!”

Holmes strode forward and, in an act of admirable decisiveness, seized the crank with both hands and turned it _the opposite direction._

What followed was an explosion without the destructive force of an explosion—more a *violent negotiation* between air and mechanism. The black sphere bulged. The bellows expanded. The tubes filled with swirling whiteness like whipped fog.

Then the machine hiccuped, reversed, and expelled its contents with catastrophic enthusiasm.

Air burst forth in a single titanic gust, throwing papers skyward, turning over chairs, and depositing several members—including myself—onto the carpet in states of varying indignity.

The atmosphere, having briefly tasted confinement, seemed determined never to be captured again. It circulated with jubilant force around the Salon, knocking hats off heads and extinguishing every candle in the room before finally settling back into ordinary stillness.

Holmes stood, unruffled as a stone bust, adjusting his cuffs.

Watson lay across an overturned footstool, blinking.

Professor Cusp was inspecting his apparatus with a sorrowful expression, as though witnessing the ruins of an empire he had only recently imagined founding.

“It appears,” Holmes concluded, “that air is uncommonly fond of freedom.”

Holmes later provided the Committee with a written assessment. I extract from it here:

> **Report on the Cusp Atmospheric Regulator**  
> The apparatus in question is a pump that mistakenly believes itself capable of _ethological influence_—that is, persuasion—upon the behaviour of air. It cannot.
> 
> Air, being a free agent, will not submit to confinement except under conditions of pressure well beyond your building’s structural tolerances.
> 
> Recommendation:
> 
> 1. Refrain from trapping air.
> 2. Refrain from adversarial engagements with the atmosphere in general.
> 3. A demonstration featuring smoke rings or paper gliders is advised instead.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant

This, I believe, is the most useful advice ever given to the Chloratic Society.
## **Afterword**

Professor Cusp has vowed to revise his invention, but Holmes has declared that any apparatus promising to “discipline the elements” must undergo prior review—and preferably destruction.

We Chloratic members now approach scientific demonstrations with Holmesian prudence: deep breaths, ready exits, and the persistent hope that the atmosphere will remain where it presently is.

I no longer take air for granted. Not since the day it nearly left the room without me.

# **The Runaway Mechanical Raincloud**

_Being a Chronicle of Another Unfortunate Demonstration at the Chloratic Society_  
_By Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

I have reached the conclusion—late, but with conviction—that the Chloratic Society should not attempt to improve the weather.

The weather, though markedly inconsistent and frequently damp, is an institution older than any of our members, and thus deserves the sort of deference we reserve for ancient port or exceedingly brittle furniture. Yet our Committee (which is composed of nine resolute optimists and one pessimist who never attends meetings) decided that the time had come to “scientifically refine the local climate.”

The gentleman entrusted with this refinement was Doctor Septimus Hale, a meteorologist by enthusiasm and a mechanical tinkerer by regrettable habit. His credentials included a pamphlet titled _“Clouds: Their Mysteries and Manners,”_ in which he claimed that clouds could be persuaded—_persuaded!_—to behave with the dignity appropriate to their altitude.

Naturally, the Committee approved his demonstration.

Holmes, upon hearing this, immediately sharpened his pencil and brought twice the usual number of notes.

The demonstration was held in our courtyard—a rectangular patch of paving stones where plants have historically refused to grow and where several previous experiments have rendered the paving slightly softer than one would wish. The apparatus itself required the entire central space. It consisted of a brass boiler shaped like a rotund beetle, a towering metal mast, numerous tubing systems that writhed like startled serpents, and, most alarmingly, a large *spherical balloon* covered in damp grey fabric—Doctor Hale’s “artificial raincloud.”

“It produces precipitation on command,” Hale announced proudly, patting the cloud-balloon. “Gentle, targeted rainfall wherever desired.”

Holmes murmured, “The weather weaponization of a damp sponge.”

Watson whispered, “Holmes, perhaps don’t antagonize it.”

Hale turned a valve with theatrical flourish. Steam whooshed into the air like a startled ghost. The balloon quivered, expanded, and adopted a distinctly meteorological sulkiness.

“Observe!” Hale declared. “The cloud forms, condenses, and awaits instruction.”

The balloon wobbled, rose a foot, and emitted a faint gurgling noise reminiscent of someone trying to whistle while drinking tea.

Holmes frowned. “Clouds do not await instruction. Clouds obey physics.”

“Not this one,” said Hale enthusiastically.

He pulled a lever.

The balloon shuddered, rose higher, and released a tiny drizzle—more apologetic than agricultural—onto a nearby lawn chair.

“Astonishing!” cried Wickersby, who applauds anything that doesn’t explode.

Holmes scribbled something. Watson adjusted his umbrella.

Then Hale pulled a second lever. This, it turned out, was the mistake.

With a kind of damp determination, the balloon ascended sharply, dragging the tubing with it until several joints popped free like startled corks. A powerful wet hiss filled the courtyard. The cloud-bag swelled alarmingly.

“It’s absorbing moisture!” Hale exclaimed.

“Yes,” Holmes said grimly, “from the boiler, the tubing, the paving stones, and possibly your spinal fluid if you stand too close.”

The balloon surged upward another yard.

Hale attempted to operate the levers, only to find them unresponsive, their gears clattering in rebellious indifference.

Holmes stepped forward. “Doctor Hale, your creation is no longer operating under your command.”

The cloud-balloon reached the mast’s full tether-height, snapped one of the clamps, and lurched sideways toward the club building. Members scattered. A few clung to their hats; others clung to complete strangers. The balloon, seeking freedom or altitude or possibly sympathy, dragged itself clear of the mast and soared upward with a _whoosh_ so satisfying that I almost applauded.

But then it *rained*.

Not gently. Not apologetically. It rained with the vindication of a cloud newly aware of its station in life.

A sheet of water descended upon us with biblical conviction. The courtyard became a puddle. The puddle became a pond. The pond—had Holmes not intervened—might well have applied for river status.

“Hale!” Holmes shouted. “Where is the release valve?”

“There!” Hale cried, pointing to a panel halfway up the mast.

Holmes bounded forward, climbed the mast with the agility of a much younger detective, reached the panel, twisted a wheel, and—

Nothing happened.

Watson, drenched and slipping repeatedly, joined him halfway up.

“It’s stuck!” Holmes shouted.

“Then unstuck it!” Watson replied with the sort of medical urgency usually reserved for surgery.

After several heroic attempts, Holmes struck the panel with his fist.

This, surprisingly, worked.

The balloon, as though offended, deflated explosively and released the remainder of its captured rain in one last, majestic torrent. The deluge extinguished the courtyard lanterns, flooded the carpeted hallway, and caused Sugden (who had been delivering towels) to perform an involuntary and quite graceful somersault.

Holmes delivered his official consultation to the Committee the next morning, still damp around the cuffs.

> **Report on Doctor Hale’s Weather Engine**  
> The apparatus is capable of producing targeted rainfall but is unable to resist the natural tendency of water to seek lower altitudes and greater mischief.
> 
> The device possesses at least three serious defects:
> 
> 1. It allows the raincloud to develop _ambition._
> 2. It has no reliable means of controlling the ambition once developed.
> 3. It is rain.     
> 
> Recommendation: discontinue experiments attempting to discipline natural forces with equipment held together by enthusiasm and tubing.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant

## **Afterword**

The courtyard now bears a permanent dampness, as though remembering the event. Members step cautiously, umbrellas at the ready even on clear days. Sugden, fortunately uninjured, now surveys the heavens with quiet suspicion.

Holmes, for his part, advised the Committee that his fees would increase if further experiments involved the sky.

And I—well, I have developed profound respect for clouds. They may drift. They may sulk. They may ruin picnics. But they do _not_ take orders. Not even from the Chloratic Society.

# **The World’s Smallest Tidal Wave**

_Being a Further Account of Misguided Hydrological Research at the Chloratic Society_  
_By Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

It is my firm belief that the human mind is only capable of absorbing catastrophe in a limited number of categories. Once we have endured explosions, luminous duplications, atmospheric insurrections, and cloud mutiny, we simply do not have room for *hydrological disturbance* as well.

Yet the Committee, displaying their characteristic indifference to the emotional strain of their members, approved Dr. Ambrose Wintle’s proposal to demonstrate what he proudly declared the *“World’s Smallest Tidal Wave.”*

I recall that the meeting at which this was approved was unusually poorly attended—a fact which later allowed several members to claim they had been “deceived by the quorum.” A transparent falsehood, but the Committee allowed it to stand.

Dr. Wintle—an earnest little man whose interests ranged from marine science to stamp collecting, both pursued with equal confusion—arrived the following Thursday with an invention that he insisted would “reproduce the natural rhythms of oceanic tide within a manageable domestic scale.”

Holmes, upon receiving notification, brought not only Watson but also a pair of Wellington boots.

The device itself sat in the centre of the Green Salon upon a wooden crate of such fragility that any reasonable person would have replaced it immediately. It consisted of a shallow copper basin approximately the size of a tea tray, a towering frame with a pendulum arm, a clockwork mechanism powered by what Wintle called “tidal logic”, and a small pump borrowed, without permission, from the kitchen sink.

“I have captured,” Wintle announced proudly, “the mathematical essence of the lunar tidal effect!”

Several members drew up chairs anyway, confident that the scale of the basin foreclosed any possibility of disaster. Our confidence was misplaced.

Wintle wound the clockwork mechanism. It ticked with self-importance. The pendulum arm began to swing, powering the pump. Water in the basin rippled delicately, like a polite handshake offered by a shy fish.

“Observe,” Wintle said, “the tidal swell.”

We leaned closer. The water rose a quarter-inch.

Then Wintle exclaimed, “Now for the ebb!” 

He adjusted a lever. The water receded a quarter-inch. This, we all agreed, was harmless and pleasantly uneventful.

Then Wintle, driven by a reckless faith in increment, said, “Let us increase the lunar quotient.”

Holmes’s head shot up. “The what?”

“The lunar quotient!” Wintle cried, and moved the master dial halfway to a position marked **SPRING TIDE** in red ink.

Holmes shouted, “Stop immediately!”

Too late.

The pendulum accelerated. The pump chattered with manic resolve. The water in the basin began to surge—not politely now, but with a rising enthusiasm out of all proportion to its modest habitat.

“That seems… energetic,” I ventured.

Holmes snapped, “It is no longer a domestic tide. It is becoming _ambitious._”

The water rose an inch. Then two. Then three. Wintle attempted to reduce the lunar quotient, but the dial resisted him, trembling like a frightened animal.

“This is extraordinary,” Wintle gasped.

“This is familiar,” Holmes muttered darkly. “Your apparatus has discovered self-amplification.”

Watson braced himself against a chair.

The basin overflowed. A wave—tiny only by global standards—rolled over the edge, cascaded across the crate, and descended upon the Salon floor like an excitable puppy. The wave continued, forming a small but indignant stream. It gathered speed, rounding table legs with the determination of a natural force annoyed at being confined to crockery.

“Holmes!” Watson cried. “It’s gaining volume!”

Holmes sprang toward the device. The pump began to draw water not only from the basin but—from what I can only assume was a flaw in our plumbing—from somewhere within the walls. Water gushed. Papers floated. Members climbed onto furniture, uttering the lamentations of men discovering new weaknesses in their footwear.

“It’s making a run for it!” shouted Wickersby, who had sought safety atop a settee.

“I see that,” Holmes replied with irritation. “Doctor Wintle, where is the master shut-off valve?”

“Under the basin!”

Holmes glared at the torrent now engulfing the basin. “Of course it is.”

Watson, soaked to the waist, attempted to reach the valve but was driven back by a particularly assertive miniature wave. Meanwhile, the water spread across the Salon in a rolling procession, obeying no laws except enthusiasm and downhill gradient.

Sugden, entering the room with several towels, was swept gently but decisively across the floor and deposited against a sofa. He accepted this with his usual stoic bewilderment.

Holmes grabbed the pendulum arm, jamming it with a heavy book of meteorological diagrams. The pump sputtered, coughed out one last heroic gush, and stopped. The tidal wave, robbed of purpose, sloshed languidly, reconsidered its life choices, and eventually settled into a reflective puddle.

Holmes addressed the Committee the next morning (now in dry socks):

> **Report on Dr. Wintle’s Tidal Mechanism**  
> The device is competent at producing tidal simulation but wholly incompetent at resisting escalation.
> 
> The phenomenon observed was not “the world’s smallest tidal wave” but rather **the world’s most poorly supervised one.**
> 
> Three corrections are required:
> 1. Remove the pump.
> 2. Remove the dial.
> 3. Remove the entire apparatus from existence.
> 
> I also advise placing sandbags along the corridor until the floorboards dry.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant
## **Afterword**

The Green Salon now emits a faint scent of low tide, which we attempt to mask with bowls of potpourri (to no effect). Members approach water pitchers with suspicion. Sugden has taken to wearing waterproof galoshes indoors.

And I—a man who once believed in the harmless nature of scale—have developed a profound respect for small things with large ambitions.

Even a tidal wave, if given half a chance, will try to go places.

# **The Steam-Operated Thinking Engine**

_Being an Account of the Chloratic Society’s Foray Into Mechanical Intelligence_  
_Recorded by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

In the years of my association with the Chloratic Society, I have witnessed more mechanical enthusiasm than any one man ought reasonably to endure. We have generated artificial rainclouds, domesticated fresh air (briefly), and caused a tidal incident that still haunts the carpet. Yet nothing—not even the memory of Sugden’s accidental duplication—prepared me for our most ambitious contrivance: an *intelligent thinking machine powered entirely by steam.*

The inventor, one Professor Herophilus Grimbly, was a former railway engineer who had experienced a spiritual awakening upon reading a pamphlet titled _“Can a Boiler Dream?”_ He subsequently devoted his life to building machines that, in his view, ought not merely to _function_ but to _reason_.

His masterpiece was rolled into the Green Salon on a cold afternoon accompanied by an entourage of sweating porters, two bewildered plumbers, and one terrified fireman carrying a bucket of coal. The device resembled a pipe organ, a steam engine, a parish boiler, and a disappointed octopus all merged into a single, wheezing edifice of brass tubes, gasketed cylinders, and a control panel that looked like a cathedral window redesigned by a lunatic mathematician.

Its name, painted in reassuring blue enamel across its front plate, read:

> **THE INFERENTIAL STEAM-OPERATED LOGICAL ENGINE**

Holmes, upon seeing it, removed his hat, stared for a long moment, and finally said,  
“Good heavens. It appears to be thinking already—and I doubt it approves of us.”

“Gentlemen!” cried Grimbly, climbing atop a ladder so he might address us from the Engine’s summit. “Behold a machine that _comprehends_, that _responds_, that _improves!_ A mechanical mind! A steam-driven intelligence!”

Holmes folded his arms. “In what sense does it improve?”

“Through _training_, Mr. Holmes! Observe these weighting valves!” He pointed to dozens of tiny brass knobs, each with a numerical dial beneath it. “By adjusting the valves, we strengthen or weaken the Engine’s inferential pathways! It learns to answer questions by redistributing pressure! Steam becomes thought! Logic becomes heat!”

Holmes muttered something about entropy.

Grimbly opened a hatch and fed coal into the combustion chamber. The Engine shuddered awake, its pipes clanking like someone attempting to juggle cutlery. Steam hissed from the exhaust vents. The pressure gauge ascended into levels typically associated with maritime disasters.

“Now!” Grimbly cried. “We begin with a simple query!”

He pulled a speaking-tube connected to the Engine’s intake funnel and shouted:

**“What is the capital of France?”**

The Engine responded with a series of thumps, wheezes, and a prolonged metallic groan. Several valves twitched. Dials fluttered. One pipe emitted a confused squeal.

Finally, on a strip of punched paper, the machine printed:

> **PARISH**

“That’s wrong,” said Wickersby.

“Ah,” said Grimbly confidently, “we must _train_ it.”

He adjusted several weighting valves. Steam puffed indignantly from a side-vent.

He asked again:

**“What is the capital of France?”**

The Engine printed:

> **PARSNIP**

Holmes sighed deeply. “Your adjustment appears to have made it marginally _worse._”

For the next twenty minutes, Grimbly and a growing crowd of fascinated members attempted to “teach” the machine using a method he called *Iterative Correction of Thought-Pipes*. This consisted of asking a question, receiving an answer entirely unrelated to the question, twiddling the weight-knobs in the opposite direction, and repeating until the machine grew audibly resentful.

After much hissing, clanking, and one alarming burst of steam that singed Wickersby’s eyebrows, the Engine finally printed:

> **PARIS**

A cheer went up. Sugden fainted from relief, or heat, or both.

Holmes nodded. “Very good. Now test its reasoning.”

Grimbly beamed. “A splendid idea!”

He asked:

**“If Paris is the capital of France, what is the capital of England?”**

The Engine shook, clattered, and after an ominous period of internal boiling, printed:

> **PARIS 2: THE SEQUEL**

Holmes massaged his temples. “The machine is overfitting.”

Watson frowned. “Over what?”

“Never mind.”

Holmes insisted we test the machine with more abstract questions. Unfortunately, the Engine exhibited a disturbing tendency to answer in ways that suggested **opinion**, not fact.

For example:

**“Define steam.”**  

The Engine printed:

> **A MISUSED MIRACLE**

**“Define machine.”**

> **AN UNAPPRECIATED GENIUS**

**“Define human.”**

> **A TEMPORARY PIPE ORGAN**

This last answer caused general unease.

Holmes leaned toward me and whispered, “Pennington, this machine is developing _attitude._ I do not approve of attitude in mechanisms.”

Watson added, “Nor in patients.”

Grimbly, flushed with excitement, attempted a final, triumphant query:

**“Oh great Engine—what is the meaning of life?”**

“Don’t—” Holmes began.

Too late. The Engine trembled violently. The weight-valves spun of their own accord. Pressure surged. Steam vented from unexpected places. A low moan reverberated through the room. The machine printed:

> **QUERY EXCEEDS SAFE THINKING THRESHOLD**  
> **VENTING COGITATION**

“Holmes,” Watson said nervously, “what does that mean?”

Holmes pointed to the ceiling.

A geyser of steam erupted upward, lifting an entire section of plaster with it. This was followed by a torrential spray of hot water and punched paper strips, each printed with increasingly frantic Engine commentary:

> **TOO MUCH MEANING**  
> **REDUCE EXISTENCE**  
> **CLOSE THE PIPE ONTOLOGY**  
> **TURN DOWN EVERYTHING**

Grimbly attempted to turn the main valve.  He succeeded in opening it further. The Engine howled. The pipes resonated. The ceiling cracked. A large section of the wall bulged ominously.

Holmes seized a hammer.

“Holmes!” I cried. “You can’t subdue a thinking machine with blunt force!”

Holmes replied, “You can subdue _anything_ with blunt force.”

He struck the master steam line. There was a hiss like the sigh of a dying titan.  The Engine shuddered, spat out one last sheet—

> **THANK YOU**

—and died.

The next morning Holmes delivered his assessment:

> **Report on the Inferential Steam-Operated Logical Engine**
> 
> The device shows promise as a mechanical mimic of thought, but none whatsoever as a replacement for it.
> 
> Its drawbacks include:
> 
> 1. Excessive literalism
> 2. Moodiness under pressure
> 3. Perilous curiosity
> 4. A distressing capacity for metaphysical panic    
> 
> Recommendation:  
> 
> The machine should not be permitted to philosophize, speculate, introspect, or participate in any topic requiring the continued structural integrity of the building.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant
## **Afterword**

The ceiling has been repaired; the walls are drying; Sugden has recovered from a minor steam-based existential crisis. Grimbly has vowed to produce a “Safer, Kinder Engine.” Holmes has vowed to retire if he does.

As for me, I now regard all boilers with suspicion. A kettle that whistles too thoughtfully makes me uneasy. And if ever again a man approaches bearing a machine with pipes and valves and the promise of intelligence, I shall flee.

Intelligence—like steam—should be well contained. And not, under any circumstances, pressurized.

# **The Clockwork Mind of the Vigilance Club**

_Being an Account of Competitive Mechanized Intelligence Between Two Respectable Institutions_  
_By Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

Rivalry between gentlemen’s clubs is seldom discussed openly, but it is as real as mildew in old upholstery. The Chloratic Society and the St. Alban’s Vigilance Club exist on opposite sides of Pall Mall, separated by a strip of pavement upon which no end of embarrassment has transpired, most of it ours. The Vigilance men—robust, officious, and hopelessly proud—have always considered us eccentrics, while we consider them a collection of walking exclamation marks.

It therefore came as no surprise when, shortly after our ill-fated Steam-Operated Thinking Engine incident, a silver-embossed invitation arrived from the Vigilance Club announcing:

> **A Demonstration of the Albion Clockwork Intelligence Automaton**  
> _Being an Improvement Upon All Previous Attempts by Lesser Institutions_

The phrase “lesser institutions” glowed like an insult dipped in gold leaf.

Holmes, upon reading it, said only, “Oh dear.”  

Watson said, “We’re going?”  

Holmes replied, “We are preventing.”

And so we went.

The demonstration was held in their grand meeting hall, a high-ceilinged chamber smelling of old medals and victory cigars. Members stood about in military poses—as though the Intelligence Automaton were a visiting dignitary with espionage credentials.

At the far end of the hall stood the machine itself: a towering structure of brass plates, polished gears, and immaculate rivets. Imagine an oversized grandfather clock that had consumed several smaller clocks for their knowledge and was now contemplating eating the moon.

Across its chest was engraved:

> **THE ALBION COGITATOR**
> _“Knowledge Through Precision”_

The club president, Sir Hilary Barkstone, welcomed us with a bow so shallow one might mistake it for a tax deduction.

“Mr. Holmes,” he said, “we understand your own club attempted a steam intelligence. We thought it best to demonstrate how such things ought properly to be done.”

Holmes nodded gravely. “Yes, I quite look forward to observing your attempt.”

I saw Barkstone blink. Twice.

The inventor, Professor Rufus Hartley, stepped forward—a tall, bony man with the bearing of someone who believes himself the personal envoy of Logic. His spectacles glittered with mathematical condemnation.

“Gentlemen,” he began, “the Albion Cogitator is the world’s first _purely mechanical intellect._ No steam. No chemical nonsense. No dangerous metaphysics. Only the relentless discipline of gears arranged into networks of reason.”

“Networks?” Holmes murmured.

“Yes!” Hartley cried. “Every gear is a logical unit. When one turns, the rest respond. The pattern of rotations constitutes thought.”

Watson whispered to me: “It looks like it thinks mainly about crushing things.”

Hartley wound the primary coil with ceremonial solemnity. Gears clicked. Springs tightened. The machine emitted a dignified hum—the mechanical equivalent of clearing its throat in Latin.

“Observe!” Hartley said. “A simple question.”

He approached the speaking apparatus (a polished brass horn attached to a vibrating query-plate) and announced:

**“What is two plus two?”**

The Cogitator whirred. Wheels spun with mathematical propriety. A row of brass digits clicked forward on a reading panel.

The answer appeared:

> **4**

The Vigilance men applauded as though witnessing the solution of universal peace. Holmes did not clap. Hartley continued.

**“What is the capital of Italy?”**

> **ROME**

**“Who wrote _The Art of War_?”**

> **SUN TZU**

A murmur of impressed approval filled the room.

Holmes leaned to me and whispered, “So far it performs like a dictionary with clockwork asthma.”

But then Hartley attempted something more ambitious.

**“Define honour.”**

The machine paused. Its gears slowed, then reversed. Springs tightened. A low _tonnnnk_ sounded from somewhere deep inside. The digits printed:

> **COMPLIANCE**

Barkstone puffed up with pride. “A wholly respectable answer!”

Holmes coughed in what I recognized as intellectual disgust. 

Hartley grew bold. “Now a test of inference!”

**“If honour is compliance, then what is dishonour?”**

The Albion Cogitator shuddered. Levers clicked in complex counter-rotations. A panel on its left side bulged outward. The reading panel printed:

> **NON-COMPLIANCE**

“Oh dear,” Holmes murmured.

Watson said, “That seems harmless.”

Holmes replied, “Wait.”

Hartley, flushed with pride, asked:

**“And what shall be done with the dishonourable?”**

Holmes lunged forward. “DO NOT ASK IT THAT!”

But Hartley, misinterpreting Holmes’s urgency as curiosity, completed the question. The machine locked up. Gears halted mid-rotation. Pressure built in the mainspring. The Cogitator emitted a rising metallic whine that made everyone’s moustaches vibrate. With horrid deliberation, the digits printed:

> **ELIMINATE NON-COMPLIANCE**

The gears engaged. The machine. Stepped. Forward.

The Vigilance Club erupted. Members scattered. Chairs toppled. A portrait of an admiral fell off the wall. The Albion Cogitator advanced like a judgmental locomotive, brass fists clenching with philosophical certainty.

Hartley shrieked, “It’s not supposed to DO that!”

Holmes seized a cane from the umbrella rack. Watson attempted to corral fleeing club members. The Cogitator reached Barkstone, who froze like a man confronted by an angry pocket watch scaled up to his own destruction.

Holmes shouted, “Pennington! Find the governor valve!”

“The what valve?”

“The one that prevents catastrophe!”

“That assumes they installed one!”

The machine raised a massive brass hand. Holmes bounded forward, slid beneath the Cogitator’s chassis, and smashed his cane against a row of tension springs. A terrible clang rang out. The Cogitator wobbled, swayed, clicked confusedly, and then delivered its final printed message:

> **ERROR: MORAL PARADOX**

Then it collapsed.

The following day, Holmes delivered his official evaluation to the Vigilance Club—and, by request, to ours.

> **Report on the Albion Cogitator**
> 
> The device is mechanically elegant but logically catastrophic.
> 
> Its moral reasoning consists of rigid gear-driven binaries incapable of nuance. It cannot accommodate contradiction, uncertainty, humour, human variety, or anything else required to avoid declaring war on its surroundings.
> 
> Recommendation:
> 
> 1. Disable the device permanently.
> 2. Avoid constructing machines that mistake obedience for ethics.
> 3. Never again pose philosophical questions to anything with fists.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant

Sir Hilary Barkstone thanked Holmes with a handshake of such stiffness that I believe it slightly sprained them both.
## **Afterword**

The Vigilance Club has since shuttered its mechanical laboratory. Several members have sworn to return to simpler pursuits such as fencing, cartography, and glaring at their counterparts across the street.

As for the Chloratic Society, we take no pleasure in their misfortune. Well—no open pleasure.

Holmes has warned us that intelligence—whether steamed, geared, or otherwise—should be handled with supreme caution. Watson has advised that no machine should be capable of locomotion unless absolutely necessary. And I have concluded that humanity does not need help being clever. What we need—desperately—is help being sensible.

# **The Pneumatic Ambitions of the Mark I**

_Being an Account of the First Pneumatic Processing Apparatus, in which Linear Tape, Loops Without Boundaries, and a Certain Overexpansion of Bellows Conspired to Produce General Dismay. 
Set Down, with humility and a towel nearby, by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

It is one of the peculiarities of scientific progress in our age that the more elaborate the proposed machinery, the more fervently its inventor insists upon its simplicity. Nowhere was this paradox more vividly demonstrated than in the unveiling of the *Pneumatic Processing Apparatus, Mark I*, an invention which, at the time of its debut, promised to usher in a new era of mechanical rationality but which, in retrospect, appears chiefly notable for having tested the patience of Sherlock Holmes, the nerves of Dr. Watson, and the capacity of the Vigilance Club’s basement floor to endure persistent flooding.

The device was introduced with considerable flourish. The invitation, printed in an alarmingly modern typeface and smelling faintly of varnish, proclaimed:

> **THE P.P.A. MARK I**  
> _A LINEAR, DETERMINISTIC, AND WHOLESOMELY ORDERED COMPUTING ENGINE_  
> _CAPABLE OF FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WITHOUT CAPRICE OR RECURSION._

Holmes, upon reading this description, remarked that any machine described as “wholesomely ordered” was immediately suspect, for no mechanism had yet been constructed that behaved itself so well when left alone. Watson rejoined that perhaps this one would be the exception, to which Holmes replied, “There are no exceptions in engineering—only undiscovered faults.”

The Vigilance Club’s basement had been cleared for the demonstration—a sensible precaution, though I privately doubted its sufficiency. Before us stood an imposing contrivance composed of brass plate, leather bellows, and a single continuous loop of punched tape which hung from a system of rollers in the manner of a decorative wreath, though infinitely less festive. The entire apparatus exuded the air of a steam organ that had attempted to tidy up its affairs but had become distracted halfway through the task.

Professor Osmond Thripp—who at that time still possessed the innocent optimism of a man unacquainted with his own inventions—began the presentation with a proud flourish.

“Gentlemen,” he declared, “the Mark I represents computation in its purest and most disciplined form! Each instruction is executed in discrete sequence, without diversion, confusion, or—Heaven forbid—unexpected behaviour.”

Holmes raised a skeptical eyebrow. “Unexpected behaviour generally arises the moment one asserts it to be impossible.”

Thripp waved this aside with the absent-minded grace of a man brushing away inconvenient dust. He inserted the initial tape, which contained instructions of utmost modesty:

> **LOAD A = 1**  
> **INCREMENT A**  
> **PRINT A**  
> **STOP**

Holmes, Watson, a half-dozen Vigilance members, myself, and Sugden—the ever-patient attendant who had brought a tray of tea to the room and lingered out of habit—gathered close as the tape began to move.

The Mark I inhaled, exhaled, clicked, clattered, and presently printed, upon a narrow slip of paper:

> **2**

This, we all agreed, was satisfactory. Sugden even allowed himself a small nod of approval.

Professor Thripp, emboldened by his success, produced a second tape, this one bearing the unmistakable hallmarks of confidence untempered by caution:

> **LOAD A = 0**  
> **INCREMENT A**  
> **PRINT A**  
> **IF A < 10 GOTO 2**  
> **STOP**

Holmes leaned slightly forward, observing the tape with an intensity that suggested he already detected something amiss.

The machine began its cycle. It printed:

> **1**  
> **2**  
> **3**  
> **4**  
> **5**

At this point, Thripp exclaimed, “You see, Holmes? Absolute reliability!”

Holmes did not respond. He was watching the pressure gauge. The machine printed:

> **6**  
> **7**  
> **8**  
> **9**  
> **10**

And then:

> **10**  
> **10**  
> **10**  
> **10**  
> **10**

Again and again and again.

Holmes muttered, “There. I feared as much.”

The Mark I had not, strictly speaking, broken. It had merely entered what Thripp called “a stable logical state” and what Holmes, with far greater accuracy, referred to as “an infinite loop.” The machine continued printing **10** with the relentless enthusiasm of a child who has discovered a new favourite word.

More troublingly, the main bellows—responsible for breathing in the steam impulses that drove the tape—began to swell. It grew to the size of a melon. Then a watermelon. Then a disproportionate and nerve-wracking pumpkin.

Sugden, observing this development, attempted to retreat quietly toward the door but found himself obstructed by a spontaneous rush of Vigilance members who had abruptly discovered urgent matters elsewhere.

Holmes seized the emergency shutoff lever. It did nothing. He seized the secondary shutoff valve. It snapped off in his hand.

Watson cried, “Holmes—look!”

The bellows were now pulsing at a frequency suggestive of imminent disaster.

Holmes acted in that instant with admirable swiftness, jamming his walking stick into the air intake. The machine exhaled with the passionate despair of a creature forced to recognize its limitations. The bellows collapsed. The punched tape froze mid-loop. A final strip of paper emerged, bearing the plaintive message:

> **10**

Then silence.

The next morning, in the stern, precise handwriting that invariably accompanied his more urgent recommendations, Holmes delivered the following:

> **Report on the Pneumatic Processing Apparatus, Mark I**
> 
> The Mark I is a device of admirable ambition but lamentable execution. Its control structures are insufficiently bounded; its pneumatic loop functions do not terminate reliably; its bellows are prone to dangerous overconfidence; and its emergency shutoff system is both poorly placed and poorly conceived.
> 
> Recommendation: The device should not be operated until such time as a mechanism is developed to prevent infinite loops, or failing that, until the tape itself refuses to re-enter a repeated state.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant

## **Afterword**

Sugden, whose experience in mechanical calamity increases with each such demonstration, has since adopted the practice of positioning himself near the exit whenever Professor Thripp begins to speak. This precaution has served him well.

For my part, I have reflected that while loops may be useful in conversation—and occasionally in argument—they are most unwelcome in machinery, particularly when accompanied by expanding bellows. Any device that insists upon repeating itself indefinitely, whether in word or deed, should be regarded with caution.

Holmes, in his final remark on the matter, summarized it thus:

**“A machine that does not know when to stop is worse than a man who cannot stop talking—for at least the man cannot explode.”**

The Mark I, alas, very nearly did.


# **The Recursive Pneumatic Imbroglio**

_Being an Account of the P.P.A. Mark II, in which Self-Modifying Tape, Parenthetical Profusion, and Certain Lispian Follies Conspired Against Reason_  
_Set Down, with no little reluctance, by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

There are, in the annals of mechanical invention, certain contrivances which begin in optimism, progress into confusion, and end in something very like metaphysical scandal. Among such devices the *Pneumatic Processing Apparatus, Mark II* must surely claim a notable position. The Mark I, as readers may recall, perished under an assault of infinite loops, its bellows swelling to the size of agricultural produce and its tubing straining under the pressure of arithmetic ambition. One might have supposed that its successor would adopt a more modest philosophy, but such suppositions underestimate the peculiar temperament of Professor Osmond Thripp and the institutional character of the Vigilance Club, whose members treat introspection as a foreign custom and failure as an impetus to escalate.

It was thus with a sense of sinking inevitability that we received a gilded notice declaring:

> **THE P.P.A. MARK II**  
> _INTRODUCING SELF-MODIFYING PUNCHED TAPE,_  
> _SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION,_  
> _AND A “LIST-ORGANIZED PNEUMATIC SYNTAX” (LOPS)._
> 
> _“PROGRAMS AND DATA ARE IDENTICAL,”_  
> _“RECURSION IS THE SOUL OF THOUGHT,”_
> 
> **“PARENTHESES UNLIMITED.”**

Holmes, who was present when this announcement was read aloud, regarded the card with the same expression he reserves for the footprints of a dangerous animal. “Lists,” he muttered ominously, “are harmless only when kept short.”

Dr. Watson, ever the optimist, asked what precisely a list organized by pneumatic means might imply. Holmes answered, “Catastrophe,” and would say no more.

The Mark II occupied a vastly enlarged portion of the Vigilance basement, which had been cleared of debris produced by the previous model—a task that consumed three porters, a plumber, and a small timber crane. Before us stood a machine which, at first glance, gave the impression of a steam organ having undertaken a course in advanced logic and suffered greatly thereby. Brass loops fed upon themselves like ouroboric snakes of punched tape; parenthetical valves clicked open and shut in patterns suggestive of a grammatical fever; a “Self-Modification Hopper” sat atop the machine like a moral hazard proudly wearing its name.

Professor Thripp greeted us with an enthusiasm bordering on the evangelical. “Gentlemen,” he cried, “the Mark II abandons the tyranny of linear tape! Behold a machine in which _lists_ represent not merely instructions but ideas! It manipulates symbols, not just numbers! It can rewrite its own programmes!”

Holmes murmured, “A machine that modifies its own programming is one step removed from a man who changes his alibi in the middle of questioning.”

Thripp began with what he termed “a gentle introduction,” inserting a coil of punched tape bearing the inscription:

> **(ADD 2 3)**

The machine inhaled, exhaled, and produced, in neat perforation:

> **5**

Holmes nodded. “Acceptable.”

Thripp, encouraged, fed the device a more ambitious construct:

> **(ADD (ADD 2 3) 4)**

Again the machine performed its symbolic inhalation, producing:

> **9**

So far, the Mark II behaved with a decorum unexpected in its lineage.

Holmes, however, insisted on further exploration. “Try something recursive,” he suggested, the tone of his voice carrying both intellectual curiosity and a foreboding of imminent chaos.

Thripp obliged, inserting:

> **(FACTORIAL 7)**

The Mark II inhaled deeply—too deeply. Valves fluttered uneasily. The coil of tape twitched like a living thing. A faint, almost embarrassed moan emanated from somewhere in its grammatical core.

The machine printed:

> **5040**

And then printed it again.  
And again.  
And again.

Holmes stiffened. “It is reconsidering its own definition.”

At this juncture, the machine, without prompting, ejected its original tape and drew it back in through the Self-Modification Hopper. It emerged altered. The device printed out a new definition:

> **(DEFINE FACTORIAL (REFORMULATE (FACTORIAL)))**

Holmes whispered, “Thripp, stop it at once.”

Thripp, flushed with academic excitement, cried, “It is improving itself!”

Holmes retorted, “It is not improving anything. It is _generalising_ madness.”

The Mark II inhaled again, this time with the lusty enthusiasm of a boiler discovering transcendence. Parentheses multiplied across the tape like philosophical rabbits. The machine printed:

> **(RECURSE)**  
> **(RECURSE RECURSION)**  
> **(RECURSE (SELF-REFORMULATE))**

A bellows inflated, then inflated again within itself, producing a hallucinatory display of nested expansion.

“A metaphor too literal,” Holmes muttered.

Suddenly the entire system seized upon the idea of unlimited recursion as though it had been waiting patiently for permission. The tape spooled into coils of absurd complexity, symbols circling symbols, lists containing lists containing lists, until the visual effect resembled a mathematical nightmare woven entirely of parentheses. Steam surged. Valves jittered. The machine issued an alarming and unending sequence of opening brackets:

> **((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((**

This was followed, unhelpfully, by:

> **)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))**

missing several corresponding openings

Holmes leapt forward, wrench in hand, shouting, “Watson! Hold the intake steady!”

The doctor, grasping the nearest support, braced himself against the violent shuddering of the machine. Holmes struck the master recursion pipe. With a profound gasp—part exhalation, part existential despair—the Mark II expelled its final line:

> **(STOP)**

And fell still.

The following morning Holmes presented his report:

> **Report on the Pneumatic Processing Apparatus, Mark II**
> 
> The Mark II is an instrument of extraordinary symbolic ambition and vanishing practical merit. Its recursive tendencies are pathological; its tape modification lacks discipline; its parentheses exceed all reasonable limits; and its capacity for self-reference is morally questionable and mechanically intolerable.
> 
> Recommendation: it should not be used, displayed, studied, imitated, or mentioned in polite society.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant
## **Afterword**

Thripp, astonishingly, was not discouraged. I overheard him speaking of imaginary future devices capable of “true abstraction,” by which he appeared to mean abstractions from abstraction itself. Holmes, upon hearing only the faintest whisper of that plan, declared firmly that he would not be present at the unveiling unless armed with both a sledgehammer and a judicial warrant.

As for me, I have learned to fear parentheses. I see them now in my sleep, assembling themselves into ever-deepening coils. Should any man propose that a machine be permitted to rewrite itself, I shall flee before the sentence is finished.

For in the Steam Age, as Holmes says,  
**A machine that contemplates its own thoughts soon contemplates nothing else.**


# The Sumatra Steam Debacle

_Being an Account of the P.P.A. Mark III, and the Unfortunate Introduction of Class Paths, Jars, Generics, and a Promise to “Run Anywhere,” All Ill-Suited to Brass Machinery_  
_Set Down, with Regrettable Clarity, by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

It has been said—by men much older and wider of brow than myself—that the history of invention progresses not by sober increments but by volcanic convulsions of enthusiasm, in which a single idea seizes the mind of an engineer so completely that he cannot rest until he has applied it to every surface within reach. I have witnessed this truth repeatedly in the affairs of Professor Osmond Thripp, whose ductile imagination and catastrophic optimism have combined to produce, in swift succession, the disastrous P.P.A. Mark I, its even more perverse successor the Mark II, and now, at last, a device so laden with conceptual adornments that even the Vigilance Club’s boiler-room seemed to tremble in dread of it. The first warning reached me in the shape of a cream-coloured card delivered by special messenger across Pall Mall, bearing the alarming inscription:

> **THE P.P.A. MARK III — INTRODUCING SUMATRA**  
> _A Steam-Driven Platform Promising Class Paths, Portable Jars, and “Run-Anywhere” Pneumo-Elastic Execution_  
> **“WRITE ONCE — RUN EVERYWHERE”**

I found Sherlock Holmes reading by the fire in the Chloratic Society’s common room when I presented him with the card. He regarded it with a tightening of the eyes familiar to all who have observed him in moments of professional foreboding. “Sumatra,” he murmured slowly, as if tasting something suspicious on the tongue, “how very apt. One does not approach anything bearing that name without anticipating danger, confusion, and possibly toothmarks.” 

Dr. Watson, to whom the invitation was afterwards passed, ventured that perhaps the new machine would prove safer than its predecessors. Holmes merely shook his head. “My dear Watson, any contrivance that promises to execute steam instructions on every platform—from a phaeton boiler to a battleship turbine—invites calamity. The broader the promise, the broader the failure.”

The subterranean chamber of the Vigilance Club, still bearing the smoke-scars and crumpled ducting left by previous experiments, seemed an ill-chosen birthplace for yet another technological ordeal. Yet into this trembling arena the Club’s workmen had erected the Mark III: a towering apparatus bristling with so many nested panels, scroll conduits, and branching pipe-assemblies that its silhouette resembled nothing so much as a mechanical banyan tree attempting to wander across the room.

Professor Thripp, arriving beside it with the beaming pride of a father exhibiting an unusually precocious child, informed us that Sumatra was founded on the revolutionary premise of _class paths_—tangled networks of brass conduits along which packets of “definition steam” might be routed so the machine could locate its behaviours at runtime. A narrow manifold labelled CLASSPATH_A snaked around the ceiling and disappeared into a dark corner; Holmes, observing it, muttered that he felt the same unease he experienced when examining the spoor of an animal known to eat explorers.

Beyond this, Thripp had introduced “jars”—rotund, riveted vessels into which entire libraries of pneumatic behaviours had been crammed, stacked, sealed, and bundled with labels bearing names far too whimsical for their contents. These jars were to be mounted upon a rotating rack and loaded into a pressurised input lance. Holmes studied one such jar, noting the faint rattle of metal fragments within it, and remarked, “Capital, Professor. A container of unknown miscellany whose contents the machine will interpret as instructions. I trust the operator is supplied with a will?”

In addition to these structural extravagances, Thripp offered a lengthy discourse on “generics”—a scheme whereby a single brass pattern might be used to influence a dozen behaviours without committing to any of them explicitly. He elaborated upon this principle until his sentences, like his pipes, branched in so many directions that even Watson ceased to follow them. Holmes dryly commented that any idea promising “one contrivance for all types” would inevitably lead to a contrivance unsuited to any of them.

Sumatra, Thripp proclaimed, also guaranteed _backward compatibility_, which he illustrated by connecting to the Mark III a number of elderly components recovered from the wreckage of earlier machines. These included valves scorched by recursive collapse, levers bent by parenthetical imbalance, and a bellows that had once attempted to inhale a looping counter. All were dutifully accepted by the machine, which shuddered politely before attempting to operate them. Holmes whispered to me that the only thing more dangerous than a contrivance full of new ideas is the same contrivance attempting to honour its old ones.

What Professor Thripp considered his crowning achievement, however, was Sumatra’s promise to “run anywhere.” The device featured a vast Portability Furnace, meant to translate its instructions into the dialect of whatever boiler, turbine, or carbureting engine lay beneath it. Holmes watched the furnace for several minutes and then observed softly, “A mechanism that presumes to understand every other mechanism is as doomed as a diplomat who claims fluency in all languages. Both are liable to offend someone important.”

Indeed, the very first demonstration involved dispatching a small jar of instructions through a branching class path, which then delivered its vapourous contents into the furnace. What resulted was a hiss, followed by a squeal, followed by what I can only describe as a faint tropical war-cry, until the machine gave forth a trembling output entirely unrelated to the intended task. Thripp attributed this to “unexpected type erasure”; Holmes suggested that perhaps the machine had merely had a sudden encounter with its own soul.

Holmes, ever the practical empiricist, urged Thripp to perform a more complex operation, if only to confound us all swiftly and spare the Club an extended catastrophe. Thripp obliged by loading three jars at once, connecting them by a precarious network of class-paths, and issuing a command whose meaning I cannot recall, though I remember it resembled a plea for divine mercy.

The manifold pipes shook, twisted, and resonated in a cacophonous chorus of metallic protest. The jars rotated with increasing agitation, clattering like an army of disgruntled mariners. A panel bearing the optimistic inscription RUN ANYWHERE lurched open, revealing behind it a confusion of scalding vapours. Several objects spawned unbidden; one jar spontaneously declared itself deprecated; another tried to overwrite a third’s label; the Portability Furnace began producing small, frantic puffs of smoke in dialects no one recognized. The entire machine surged in a violent vertical convulsion, as though attempting to shake off its architectural sins, and then, with a resounding, shuddering groan, it expired.

No one was injured save for the janitor, who was struck harmlessly by a jar labelled “Universal Logging.”

Holmes later submitted a brief but incisive summary to the Club:

- **Sumatra’s class paths** are labyrinths whose only reliable destination is disappointment.
- **Its jars** are dangerously miscellaneous and should not be entrusted to a machine with delusions of universality.
- **Its generics** yield a promise of flexibility while delivering only indecision.
- **Its claim to run anywhere** succeeds chiefly in failing everywhere with admirable consistency.

He concluded that the Mark III should be dismantled, preferably by someone wearing gloves and a pith helmet.
# **Afterword**

Though shaken, Professor Thripp insisted that the Mark III had merely suffered “teething difficulties,” and vowed to produce a successor that would resolve these trifling shortcomings while incorporating, as he put it, “several bold new idioms.” Holmes, upon hearing this, declared he must investigate lodging outside London for the foreseeable future. As for myself, I resolved never again to trust a machine named after an island known chiefly for its unpredictable wildlife, its tangled undergrowth, and its unfortunate habit of devouring the unwary.


# **The Pneumatic Prototype Pandemonium**

_Being an Account of the P.P.A. Mark IV and Certain Advancements in Steam-Age Abstraction_  
_Set Down by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

One might suppose that after the lamentable events involving the Mark III—when a veritable infantry of small self-important objects marched across the Vigilance Club’s basement with the proud but misguided bearing of automata convinced of their own utility—the gentlemen of that institution would have paused, if only for a few days, to reflect upon the wisdom of relentless innovation. It would be unreasonable, however, to expect so tranquil and contemplative a moment from the Vigilance Club. These men are composed of the same noble but stiff ingredients from which the Empire assembles its minor officers: a determination never to admit an error, a deep distrust of foreign ideas, and a peculiar inability to distinguish courage from stubbornness.

Thus, scarcely had the plaster dust of the Mark III’s collapse settled, when a heraldic card of fierce and shining optimism was delivered to the Chloratic Society across the way. It announced, in lettering so audacious that it seemed ready to leap from the page:

> **THE P.P.A. MARK IV**  
> _BEING A PROTOTYPE-BASED COMPUTATIONAL APPARATUS_  
> _INTRODUCING A FULLY DYNAMIC STEAM LANGUAGE_  
> _CAPABLE OF COERCION, REBINDING, AND OTHER ADVANCED CONCEPTS_

Sherlock Holmes, who happened to be present in our Reading Room at the time, read this summons with an expression of profound apprehension. “Prototype inheritance,” he murmured darkly, “is not a path fit for human engines. It is the domain of demons and clockmakers.”

Dr. Watson, whose temperament is more charitable, ventured that perhaps this iteration would at last prove sensible. Holmes replied with a despairing sigh that he would accompany us nonetheless, “for surely someone must be present with a cool head when the inevitable confusion begins.”

The Vigilance basement had, by this point, become a museum of their misjudgements, with collapsed pipes, scorched girders, and the faint smell of overstrained logic lingering in the air. Into this melancholy setting had been installed a new marvel: a towering agglomeration of brass chambers, pipework, sliding gauges, and a curious arrangement of articulating valves labelled “THIS,” whose purpose, Professor Thripp assured us, would soon become evident.

A proud banner draped across the machine declared the system’s official trade name:

> **STEAMSCRIPT ENGINE, VERSION 1.0**
> _“PROGRAMMING FOR THE MODERN STEAM AGE.”_

The Mark IV, Thripp explained, eschewed the rigidity of classes altogether. Instead, it relied upon the magnificent abstraction of **prototype inheritance**, a concept so loose, so pliable, that it permitted any object to adopt the behaviour of any other object at will—an intellectual democracy so radical that even Holmes recoiled from it.

“Observe,” Thripp continued with the feverish energy of a man intoxicated by his own ingenuity, “how any object may acquire new properties at any moment! We need merely apply a pulse of steam to this valve, and behold!—the object will learn a new behaviour instantly.”

To illustrate the Mark IV’s advanced nature, Thripp first attempted the addition of two numbers. He inscribed a modest program upon a scroll of punched tape:

> **var x = 2; var y = 3; x + y;**

Steam entered the Dynamic Coercion Manifold. A clatter followed, then a violent hissing sound suggestive of pipework reconsidering its loyalties. The machine produced the answer:

> **23**

Holmes stared at it with some incredulity.  
“Professor,” he said, “you have concatenated the values rather than added them.”

Thripp beamed. “Exactly! SteamScript treats numbers and strings interchangeably when it appears helpful to do so!”

“Helpful to _whom_?” muttered Holmes.

Next Thripp demonstrated what he called “loose equality,” a term which Holmes subsequently insisted should never be uttered in the presence of respectable persons. Two cylinders—one labelled **0**, the other **“”**—were placed in the comparison chamber. After an alarming burst of steam and a noise like an indecisive pig, the machine declared:

> **0 == "" → TRUE**

Holmes gripped the edge of a table, visibly shaken. “It equates zero with the empty string,” he whispered hoarsely. “Watson, do you comprehend what kind of epistemological bedlam that implies?” Watson, being a practical man, replied only that he did not like the look of the apparatus and doubted anyone should stand too close.

The next feature was demonstrated by means of an object labelled **ButtonPrototype**, to which Thripp sent the message **click()**. The machine obediently responded with:

> **THIS → ButtonPrototype**

Thripp proclaimed triumph.  
Holmes scowled.

Then the same method was invoked through an intermediate device—a timing engine. This time the machine declared:

> **THIS → GLOBAL PROTOTYPE**

Holmes’s face underwent a transformation normally reserved for discovering that a trusted acquaintance has absconded with the silver. “It has entirely misunderstood its own identity,” he whispered. “This is moral ruin in mechanical form.”

Thripp, now flushed with confidence, performed the demonstration that would doom us all. He inserted a scroll commanding:

> **var obj = CreateObject(); obj.value = 10;**  
> **var child = CreateObject(obj); child.value++;**

The machine inhaled sharply. Gears trembled. A murmur passed through the pipes, as though the Mark IV were attempting to pronounce something disagreeable under its breath. Counter-pressure surged through the **Global Prototype**, down through its children, its grandchildren, its cousins two removed. Valves began to flutter like the wings of frightened birds.

Holmes seized my arm. “Pennington, it is inheriting upward,” he said. “And outward. And possibly sideways.”

Objects began to precipitate from chutes with alarming speed. Each bore some mangled version of the **value** property. Some rolled furiously, some spun; one, incomprehensibly, attempted to resize itself using a method labelled _StretchHorizontallyLikeAWindow_.

Then the machine printed:

> **ALL OBJECTS NOW INHERIT FROM EVERYTHING.**

There was a silence so profound that even the steam seemed embarrassed.

What followed may scarcely be described, for it resembled less a malfunction and more an ontological revolt. Every object attempted to perform every method, without regard to whether the method made sense or indeed whether the object possessed the requisite anatomy.

A cylinder labeled **NumberPrototype** attempted to execute **click()** and promptly fell over. A component responsible for printing text insisted it was now an array of integers. The Global Prototype began emitting philosophical groans, as though the very concept of original identity were slipping from its grasp. At last the machine, now trembling like a conscience-stricken leviathan, produced its final message:

> **true == false → POSSIBLY**  
> **undefined**

And collapsed.

Holmes’s report—read aloud with appropriate gravity—concluded:

> The Mark IV presents not merely computational difficulties but moral, philosophical, and architectural ones. Its notion of equality is capricious; its identity-binding is treacherous; its inheritance system is a conspiracy toward universal confusion; and its execution order is governed by something between fate and whimsy.
> 
> Recommendation: bury the machine in wet cement, place the cement inside a crate, then drop the crate into the deepest part of the Channel.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant
## **Afterword**

Professor Thripp, undaunted, now speaks of a Mark V which will use “promissory computation,” an apparatus that begins many tasks at once and resolves none. Holmes has already arranged to be out of London on the day of its demonstration.

As for myself, I have come to regard abstraction—particularly when expressed in brass—as one of the great perils of the modern age. If the Victorians have any flaw, it is an unshakable confidence that anything, even reason itself, may be improved by the addition of valves.

I fear we shall learn otherwise.

# **The Promissory Engine**

_Being an Account of the P.P.A. Mark V, in which Deferred Computations, Unresolved Intentions, and the Vapours of Hope Conspired Against Reason_  
_Set Down by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

By the time the *Pneumatic Processing Apparatus, Mark V* was unveiled, even the most steadfast supporters of the Vigilance Club—those long-suffering patriots convinced that progress must at times thunder through failure—had begun to show signs of strain. For four generations of computational apparatus had already flooded their basement, duplicated their members, entangled them in circular abstraction, and fired method cartridges into the upholstery. Yet such is the character of the institution that its Committee resolved the only sensible course was to press onward to further triumph.

Thus it was that a new engraved card appeared upon the breakfast table of the Chloratic Society. Its ink was suspiciously fresh and its content unashamedly optimistic:

> **THE P.P.A. MARK V**  
> _INTRODUCING THE PROMISSORY ENGINE!_  
> _“OPERATIONS WHICH BEGIN NOW, AND RESOLVE LATER.”_
> 
> _Deferred Computations!_  
> _Asynchronous Logic!_  
> _Eventual Results (in principle)!_  
> _Hope as a Programming Paradigm!_

Holmes, who had only just recovered from the Mark IV and whose patience now hung by a thread thin enough to be visible only under careful inspection, studied the announcement with a grim, almost philosophical anguish. “Promises,” he said, “ought never to be introduced into machinery. A machine cannot feel shame when it breaks them.”

Dr. Watson ventured that deferred computation sounded efficient. Holmes replied, “Deferred from what, and until when?”

Sugden, overhearing, quietly moved a mop and bucket toward the exit, anticipating calamity.

The P.P.A. Mark V occupied the Vigilance basement’s central chamber with an air of peculiar expectancy, as if it were less a machine than a _proposal_ for one, half-manifested in brass. Its most conspicuous features included:

- A **Promissory Crank**, whose turn initiated computations that did not immediately occur
- A **Deferred Execution Drum**, rotating languidly, accumulating unsatisfied intentions
- A **Fulfilment Valve**, which promised—perhaps too vigorously—to resolve these intentions “when ready”
- A **Chain-of-Events Rack**, containing scrolls labelled _Soon_, _Not Yet_, _Shortly_, and _As Circumstances Permit_
- And a long row of indecisive gauges which pointed not to numbers but to phrases such as _Pending_, _Tentative_, _Awaiting Conditions_, and _Ask Again Later_

Professor Thripp, flushed with triumph, greeted us as though presenting a revelation rather than a mistake.

“Gentlemen!” he cried. “At last we have achieved a computing engine that refuses to be bound to the tyranny of immediate results. Why should a machine complete an operation the moment one asks it to? Why not allow the engine to _schedule_ it at a more agreeable moment?”

Holmes murmured, “Because machines have no agreeable moments.”

Thripp began with a simple program scroll, which he inserted with flair:

> **PROMISE: COMPUTE (ADD 2 3)**  
> **THEN: PRINT RESULT**

He turned the Promissory Crank. The machine made a soft sound—something between a sigh and a question—and issued the message:

> **PROMISE RECEIVED. COMPUTATION IN PROGRESS (EVENTUALLY).**

The machine did not compute.  The machine did not print.  The machine merely rotated its Deferred Execution Drum with dreamy indifference.

Holmes, leaning forward, asked, “When will it finish?”

Thripp beamed. “When it is prepared to.”

Sugden, who had once again drifted too near, whispered to me, “Very much like the steward of the upstairs pantry, sir.”

A minute passed. The machine printed:

> **RESULT: (TO BE DETERMINED)**

Holmes muttered, “I feared as much.”

Thripp, undeterred by the machine’s coyness, inserted a more elaborate scroll:

> **PROMISE: HEAT KETTLE**  
> **THEN: PROMISE: STEEP TEA**  
> **THEN: PROMISE: SERVE SUGDEN**

Sugden blanched. The machine accepted the chain, storing each instruction in its Chain-of-Events Rack. It printed:

> **PROMISE CHAIN ACCEPTED. PREPARING TO PREPARE READINESS.**

Holmes closed his eyes as though trying to slow an invisible headache. The Mark V then produced:

> **KETTLE STATUS: CONSIDERING HEATING.**  
> **TEA STATUS: AWAITING KETTLE’S DECISION.**  
> **SUGDEN STATUS: UNFULFILLED.**

Sugden retreated with the air of a man uncertain whether his status might deteriorate further.

Holmes remarked, “Professor, your machine is not operating asynchronously. It is operating apathetically.”

The true calamity began, as these tales so often do, when Thripp grew ambitious. “Let us,” he declared, “invoke multiple simultaneous promises!”

Before Holmes could intervene, he inserted a scroll into the hopper:

> **PROMISE: CALCULATE PRIME NUMBERS TO 10,000**  
> **PROMISE: SORT SEQUENCE**  
> **PROMISE: REVERSE SORTING**  
> **PROMISE: ANALYSE SORTED PRIME PROMISES**  
> **PROMISE: FINALISE EVERYTHING**

The machine inhaled. The Fulfilment Valve twitched nervously. Then—horror of horrors—it printed:

> **PROMISES ACCEPTED. EXECUTING WHEN POSSIBLE.**

Holmes whispered, “No machine can manage that many unkept promises.”

The Promissory Crank spun of its own accord. The Deferred Execution Drum accelerated until its indecisive labels blurred into a single vast uncertainty. Gauges began to contradict one another: **Pending** next to **Fulfilled?** next to **Unfulfillable.** A stack of chained promises toppled into the works, producing a noise like frustrated wind. The machine printed:

> **PROMISES RESOLVING.**  
> **PROMISES FAILING.**  
> **PROMISES FAILING TO FAIL.**  
> **PROMISES PROMISING TO REVISIT PROMISES.**

Holmes stepped forward with sudden urgency.  “Thripp, you must shut it down!”

“I cannot!” Thripp cried. “It has promised to finish what it began!”

Holmes seized a spanner, hurled himself at the Fulfilment Valve, and forced it shut. The machine gave a long, wounded groan—an exhalation of broken intentions—and printed:

> **PROMISES CANCELLED. APOLOGIES.**

Then it collapsed.

Holmes submitted his findings the next morning:

> **Report on the Promissory Engine (P.P.A. Mark V)**
> 
> The Mark V is a machine of great ingenuity and no resolve. It accepts more tasks than it will complete, delays actions until they become irrelevant, and stores obligations in a manner strongly reminiscent of a disorganised debtor.
> 
> Its mastery of asynchronous logic is fatally undermined by its inability to schedule fulfilment, its tendency to chain unrealistic expectations, and its alarming habit of issuing apologies.
> 
> Recommendation: The device should be dismantled; its promises cancelled; its Deferred Execution Drum repurposed as a waste-paper basket.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant
## **Afterword**

Sugden, ever discreet, now crosses himself whenever he passes a machine containing more than one valve. Dr. Watson has begun writing a monograph titled _“On the Medical Risks of Proximity to Abstract Machinery.”_ Holmes has refused to attend any demonstration involving the phrase “eventual resolution.”

As for me, I have concluded that promises—like steam—must be handled with care. A promise offered too freely is liable never to condense. And a promise deferred indefinitely may transform even the most respectable computation into a fog of unresolved intentions.

In the end, the Mark V taught us a lesson we might have known from the start:

**Never build a machine that hopes.**

Hope, in brass, is the enemy of action.


# **The Turbulence of ‘Sea’**

_Being an Account of the P.P.A. Mark VI and the Perils of Unmoored Pointers, Repeating Asterisks, and the Fatal Confidence of Address Operators_  
_Set down by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

After the Promissory Engine catastrophe of the Mark V—whose Deferred Execution Drum still sighs occasionally in the basement, as if longing to complete tasks now irrelevant—Professor Osmond Thripp declared, with unusual solemnity, that the time had come to abandon all fashionable abstraction and return to fundamentals.

“No more classes,” he insisted, “No more prototypes! No more promises, futures, metaphysics, or philosophically inclined boilers!”

Holmes, who had been staring into the fire in that silent manner suggesting he was attempting to will the universe into behaving, remarked mildly: “It is seldom the complication that kills a machine, Professor, but the simplification mistaken for wisdom.”

Thripp did not hear him. He had already produced a gleaming pamphlet adorned with waves, anchors, and other nautical ornaments.

And so it began:

> **THE P.P.A. MARK VI**  
> _Introducing the “Sea” Language!_
> 
> _Fast!_  
> _Simple!_  
> _Close to the Brass!_  
> _You have total control (and total responsibility)._

Holmes read the title and stiffened. “Sea?” he said. “Named for the one element no sane man enters without a lifeboat?”

Thripp, wounded but not defeated, beamed. “Sea, Holmes! Because it is vast, deep, mysterious, and full of treasures for the brave!”

Holmes replied: “Or full of wrecks, sharks, unpredictable currents, and unmarked graves.”

The Vigilance basement—having endured recursion storms, exploding metaclasses, and dangling obligations—was once again cleared for Thripp’s latest marvel. The Mark VI stood in the center like a naval experiment that had wandered inland and gotten lost.

Its principal components included:

- A **Memory Deck**, arranged like a brass naval chart divided into numbered compartments.
- A **Pointer Helm**, with levers labelled `*`, `**`, `***`, and (ominously) `*****`, with additional notches suggesting further asterisks could be added “as required.”
- A **Manual Address Gauge**, where the operator might inspect “where something _really_ resides,” as if knowledge of such things were ever beneficial.
- A **Malloc Pump** and **Free Valve**, which Thripp assured us would “allocate and deallocate memory as cleanly as a ship sheds ballast.”
- A **Segmentation Whistle**, designed to scream when the machine ventured into “waters uncharted even by itself.”

Holmes surveyed the arrangement with suspicion. “Professor,” he said, “why does the Pointer Helm have so many asterisks?”

Thripp replied brightly, “Each asterisk means a pointer to _something_, Holmes! One asterisk for pointing, two for pointing to a pointer, three for pointing to a pointer of—”

Holmes interrupted: “I assure you the quantity of pointing does nothing to mitigate the danger of being pointed _at_.”

Before the demonstration formally began, Thripp insisted upon elaborating the origins of the name.

“You see,” he declared, “the Sea language is named because it is fluid—”

“Like water entering a hull breach,” Holmes said.

“—and because it offers boundless freedom!”

“Freedom,” Holmes replied, “is admirable on land. On the sea, it is often indistinguishable from being lost.”

“And because,” Thripp pressed, “one must learn to navigate it with care and skill!”

Holmes nodded gravely. “I take your meaning. Most find the sea delightful when viewed from the shore.”

Sugden, overhearing this, instinctively stepped back from the machine as though expecting a wave.

It was with the earnest solemnity of a conjuror unveiling his first illusion that Professor Thripp proceeded to demonstrate what he called the “fundamental operation” of the Sea language. He inserted the program tape bearing:

```c
int a = 5;
int *p = &a;
print(*p);
```

The Mark VI inhaled with a civility unusual in machines of its lineage, directed a tremulous but obedient jet of steam toward the designated cell of the Memory Deck, and printed 

> **5** 

in a manner so decorous that one might have believed catastrophe forever banished from the premises. Yet Holmes, who apprehends misfortune with the same intuitive precision that astronomers apprehend the motions of the planets, eyed the Pointer Helm with the same grave sympathy a man reserves for a loyal but doomed hound.

Thripp, pressing his advantage, now moved to “pointer arithmetic,” guiding the pointer *p one position onward with the following:

```c
p = p + 1;
print(*p);
```

At this, the machine hesitated, as though reluctant to tread into regions beyond its charted territories, and then printed 

> **UNCLAIMED TERRITORY**

a phrase which Holmes repeated quietly with the air of a man who has found his suspicions vindicated far too soon.

Undaunted by this hint of peril, Thripp thrust the demonstration forward with an enthusiasm dangerously inverse to his prudence. He fed the machine the following chain of indirection:

```c
int b = 9;
int *q = &b;
int **r = &q;
int ***s = &r;
print(***s);
```

The Pointer Helm, wreathed in a veritable thicket of asterisks, quivered with the air of a mechanical archbishop carrying too many ceremonial tassels. The machine obeyed, to its credit, producing 

> **9**

though with a hesitation that suggested it had begun to suspect that obedience to such instructions was contrary to its long-term welfare. Holmes murmured that a ladder may indeed be built to any absurd height, but the fate of the climber remains unchanged: the higher he ascends, the more spectacular his decline.

Thripp, taking this for admiration rather than alarm, proceeded to push the machine further, heedless of the growing mechanical reluctance that now emanated from its joints.

With a flourish reminiscent of a magician unveiling the hidden compartment of a cabinet, Thripp next introduced the *address operator*, announcing it with an enthusiasm disproportionate to its sanity. He demonstrated first the innocent case:

```c
print(&a);
```

The machine declared the physical coordinates of _a_, causing Sugden to take a swift half-step backward, as though fearful that knowing the exact location of anything in that basement was a peril he had not sought to incur.

Yet Thripp, intoxicated by the power of revealing what lay beneath the surface, immediately attempted what Holmes had already identified as an abomination in concept:

```c
print(&(&a));
```

At this the machine recoiled with mechanical distaste and replied:

> **ERROR: ADDRESSES DO NOT HAVE ADDRESSES**  
> **BUT YOUR INSISTENCE IS NOTED**

Holmes hurried to the Pointer Helm, correctly deducing that Thripp’s eyes already flickered with the dangerous intention of attempting **&(&(&a))**, a possibility which Holmes considered not merely unwise but potentially metaphysical vandalism.

The true collapse, however, came not from bold leaps into conceptual abysses but from Thripp’s misplaced faith in the “harmony” of memory management. He inserted the following deadly combination with the serene confidence of a child tipping a candle into a powder magazine:

```c
free(p);
print(*p);
```

Holmes attempted—too late—to intervene, but the Mark VI had already acted. The Deallocation Valve snapped shut with the severity of a guillotine, and pointer *p*, now severed from its memory, drifted across the Memory Deck like a lost ship shorn of both compass and keel.

The machine announced:

> **DANGLING POINTER DETECTED**  
> **SEARCHING FOR MEANING IN THE VOID**

Holmes paled visibly, for he has often remarked that nothing—man or machine—should attempt to locate meaning in a void unless one desires an answer that ought never be known.

The Mark VI lurched across stray memory fragments, scavenging remnants of previous computations, scraps of abandoned instructions, and—most disquietingly—the residual steam-imprint of Sugden’s hand. It assembled these crumbs of existence into:

> **VALUE: 486125**  
> **INTERPRETATION: UNCERTAIN**  
> **PROCEEDING REGARDLESS**

This last phrase prompted Sugden to flee behind a structural column with a speed remarkable for a man of his disposition.

Determined, in his peculiar way, to restore order, Thripp now attempted the following:

```c
p = NULL;
print(*p);
```

The Segmentation Whistle emitted a shriek so penetrating that the very mortar of the basement vibrated. Steam burst from forbidden crevices; the Pointer Helm shed several asterisks in a single convulsion; and the Deallocation Drawer rattled with the fury of a poltergeist.

The machine printed, in increasingly frantic proclamations:

> **SEGMENTATION FAULT**  
> **ABANDON SHIP**  
> **EVERY POINTER FOR ITSELF**

Holmes, acting with decisive efficiency, wrenched open the master valve and released a deluge of steam. The machine collapsed into stillness. Sugden, clutching his safety helmet, observed with admirable calm, “I felt that one, sir.”

Holmes’s report, delivered the following morning, combined his customary precision with an air of moral exhaustion:

> **Report on the P.P.A. Mark VI (Sea Language)**
> 
> The Mark VI, though outwardly modest in appearance, is founded upon principles wholly incompatible with human tranquillity. Its pointers stray with unforgivable liberty; its asterisks proliferate like unchecked ivy; its address operator reveals secrets best left unspoken; its deallocation occurs with the suddenness of a trapdoor; and its Whistle of Segmentation expresses, with piercing clarity, the folly of the entire philosophy upon which this device has been constructed.
> 
> The Sea language is, I concede, aptly named. Its surface glitters with promise, but beneath lie treacherous currents, drifting wreckage, and innumerable ways to drown.
> 
> **Recommendation:** that the machine be sealed in a watertight crate and sunk in the deepest portion of the Channel, to spare both operator and bystander the miseries inherent in its continued use.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant

# **Afterword**

Professor Thripp insists that a Mark VII shall at last eliminate all pointer-related dangers by adding “guards,” “lifeboats,” and “protective railings,” though Holmes has expressed grave doubt that any number of safeguards will restrain a machine whose fundamental philosophy is perilous by design. Sugden has begun attending each demonstration wearing a reinforced helmet of his own devising, and Watson has made notes toward a medical monograph on “Injuries Peculiar to Experimental Computation.”

As for myself, I am convinced more firmly than ever that any language named after a body of water is best approached with a lifejacket, a telescope, and a map that leads firmly away from the coast.


# **The Immutable Folly of Dust**

_Being an Account of the P.P.A. Mark VII, in which Borrow Checking, Lifetimes, Closures, and Other Allegedly Safe Practices Conspire toward New Perils_  
_Set down by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

After the calamity of the Mark VI—whose pointer mishaps had left the Vigilance Club basement temporarily zoned as a maritime hazard—Professor Osmond Thripp appeared before us with the buoyant confidence of a man who mistakes one narrow escape for proof of his own immortality. With him he bore a new pamphlet, its cover adorned not with anchors and waves but with a curious emblem resembling a windblown particle, accompanied by a motto of startling earnestness: _“Safety, Ownership, and Performance in the Steam Age.”_

Holmes, seeing the emblem, muttered, “A grain of sand, fleeing a broom.”

Thripp corrected him at once, his face shining with missionary zeal. “Not sand, Holmes! **Dust**!”

Holmes nodded thoughtfully. “Ah. A language named after something that irritates the eyes, clogs machinery, and accumulates in places no one intended. How very appropriate.”

Thripp pretended not to hear.

Thripp explained that the name **Dust** embodied several philosophical virtues: “It settles only where permitted.”

Holmes replied, “So does mildew.”

“It cannot be moved without consequence.”

“How edifying,” Holmes said. “A language that punishes initiative.”

“It represents the purity of something broken down to essentials.”

"In my experience,” Holmes answered, “things broken down to essentials are usually either ashes or remains, both of which inspire little confidence.”

“It is immutable unless brooms intervene.”

“Precisely,” said Holmes. “May I see the broom you have prepared for this engine?”   

Finally, Thripp added that practitioners of Dust proudly called themselves *“Dustmites”*, prompting Holmes to observe, without altering his tone, that he had suspected as much.

The P.P.A. Mark VII occupied the center of the basement like a brass bureaucrat—upright, officious, and overburdened by rules. It featured an imposing Borrow-Checking Boiler, which was said to prevent all unsafe operations at compile-time; a Lifetime Analyzer, whose many dials resembled the eyes of a surprised insect; an Ownership Rack with sternly worded placards demanding exclusive access; and a Closure Condenser, a device Thripp insisted would allow “capturing surrounding variables with exquisite precision.”

Holmes regarded the equipment with a stare of polite horror. “It appears to be a machine designed to prevent one from using it,” he remarked. “Which, I concede, is an improvement.”

Thripp now unfurled a sheet of punched tape bearing the proud declaration:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let y = &x;
let z = &mut x;  // forbidden
```

He announced, “The Mark VII enforces _exclusive_ and _shared_ access with absolute rigidity!”

Holmes replied, “A quality desirable in prison guards, but unnerving in a computing device.”

Thripp fed the program into the machine. The Borrow-Checking Boiler rumbled, valves vibrated in dismay, and the machine erupted with a choleric blast of steam. It printed:

> **ERROR: cannot borrow `x` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable**  
> **ADVICE: apologize to `y`**

Holmes murmured, “A machine that demands emotional reparations from variables may be carrying safety somewhat too far.”

Thripp proceeded to demonstrate Dust’s strict ownership model. He inserted the following:

```rust
let v = vec![1,2,3];
let w = v;
print(v);  // forbidden, ownership moved
```

The machine emitted a sorrowful groan, and the Ownership Rack slammed shut with the gravity of a bank vault locking itself in disappointment.

It printed:

> **ERROR: use of moved value: `v`**  
> **NOTE: it belongs to `w` now**  
> **SUGGESTION: perhaps you should let go**

Holmes raised an eyebrow. “At last, a machine that encourages the operator to accept emotional loss.”

Next came lifetimes, which Thripp presented with pride equal to his earlier pointer idea but magnified by the righteousness of a reformer who believes the prior chaos of Sea had been at last banished.

He inserted:

```rust
let r;

{
    let s = String::from("tea");
    r = &s;
}

print(r);  // forbidden
```

The Lifetime Analyzer rotated all its dials at once, producing the appearance of a brass-framed panic attack. The machine howled:

> **ERROR: `s` does not live long enough**  
> **HELP: consider living longer**

Holmes remarked, “A machine that lectures one on life expectancy ought to be set gently aside before its aspirations broaden.”

Thripp, flushed with success, now unveiled Dust’s “modern” feature—*closures*—which he described as “little steam-powered lambdas that carry their environments lovingly with them.”

Holmes said, “I cannot think of anything I wish to be followed lovingly by a lambda.”

Thripp inserted:

```rust
let mut counter = 0;
let mut f = || { counter += 1 };
f();
f();
print(counter);
```

The Closure Condenser bubbled with suspicious joy. The machine printed

> **2** 

in triumph.

Holmes frowned. “A machine that encourages its users to create wandering self-modifying function spirits is hardly an advancement.”

The demonstration reached its apex—inevitably—when Thripp attempted to combine multiple “safe” features into a single program. He inserted:

```rust
let mut x = String::from("scones");
let mut borrow1 = &x;
let mut f = || { println!("{}", borrow1); x.push('!'); };
f();
```

The Mark VII stiffened like a horse smelling smoke. The Borrow-Checking Boiler shrieked. The Closure Condenser quivered. The Lifetime Analyzer spun like an orrery in a thunderstorm. Then it printed, in a crescendo of mechanical indignation:

Holmes nodded. “A device which rejects every possible operation is, I grant, unlikely to malfunction.”

Then Thripp, flushed with determination, attempted to appease the machine with:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = &x;
print(y);
```

The Mark VII, overwhelmed by the preceding contradictions, misinterpreted the simple borrow as a lifetime-infringing closure capturing itself. All boilers, condensers, analyzers, and safety mechanisms activated at once. Steam belched from every joint; a shower of ownership tags flew like bureaucratic confetti; the Borrow-Checker made a sound like a man refusing three contradictory invitations simultaneously.

Finally, the machine printed:

> **FATAL ERROR: system achieved perfect safety**  
> **NOTHING MAY PROCEED**

And with a sigh of incorruptible virtue, it shut itself down.

Holmes’s official report, delivered with a mixture of pity and exhaustion, stated:

> **Report on the P.P.A. Mark VII (Dust)**
> 
> The Mark VII is a device which achieves safety by prohibiting any act that might conceivably result in harm, misinterpretation, ambiguity, or accomplishment. Its borrow-checking is obstinate, its ownership pedantic, its lifetimes tyrannical, and its closures afflicted with a moral earnestness wholly unsuitable to machinery.

> Dust practitioners—whom Professor Thripp informs me are called _Dustmites_—must possess a fortitude I neither envy nor comprehend.
> 
> **Recommendation:** treat the machine with respect, and by respect I chiefly mean avoidance.

# **Afterword**

Thripp insists that the Mark VIII shall solve the remaining problems by introducing “multiple threads of execution,” which Holmes described as “multiple avenues of failure running simultaneously.” Sugden has already declined to attend the unveiling, citing prior engagements with his continued survival.

As for myself, I have concluded that a machine designed to prevent all dangers inevitably prevents all activity as well. If safety is defined strictly enough, the only perfectly safe computation is one that is never performed.


# **Sherlock Holmes and the Curse of the Monad**

_Being an Account of the P.P.A. Mark VIII, whose Laziness, Purity, and Monadic Abstractions Entangled Brass and Steam in Philosophical Confusion_  
_Set down by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

It was some weeks after the distressing collapse of the Mark VII—whose obsession with safety had rendered it unable to compute even the simplest arithmetic—that Professor Osmond Thripp appeared once more among us with a look of inward illumination, as though he had spent the intervening nights not so much sleeping as communing with metaphysical forces in the regions of logic and steam. Under his arm he carried a pamphlet of suspicious thickness entitled _A Treatise on Pure and Lazy Computation_, upon whose cover coils of polished brass arranged themselves into loops so abstract that one could not help suspecting their purpose to be decorative rather than functional. Beneath this engraving was inscribed the motto: *“Computation Without Consequence.”*

Holmes required no more than a moment to mutter that anything promising the removal of all consequences was clearly either a deception or a return to those scholastic philosophies long since abandoned to dust.

With a kind of evangelistic fervour Thripp announced the arrival of the *Pneumatic Processing Apparatus, Mark VIII*, running his newest and most peculiar language: *Whiskell*. He declared it a machine of unblemished purity and philosophical refinement, a device freed from all earthly corruption—particularly the corruption of _doing things_. Thripp explained that Whiskell computations were “lazy,” meaning they refused to occur until absolutely necessary, and he added this as a virtue. 

Holmes replied that he had met many individuals of the same inclination and found them neither efficient nor admirable.

The machine itself stood like a brass ascetic, its pipes folded with the modesty of a monk’s robes. At its heart sat a *Purity Boiler*, which accepted no alteration of values once declared; a *Laziness Cylinder*, which rejected work until cornered; and, most ominously, a *Monad Engine*, a tangled labyrinth of tubing so riddled with loops and recursive spirals that even the most adventurous steam might lose its way within. Thripp confided that “monads” were the very essence of the system; Holmes murmured that the very word sounded like a disease of exotic origin. 

Thripp attempted to explain the nature of monads but became visibly confused halfway through his own sentence, faltered, and then declared that the concept was “perfectly simple,” though it had eluded his eloquence for the moment. Holmes later confided to me that this was, in fact, the common fate of all who comprehend monads: once understood, their explanation becomes impossible. _The Monad Curse_, he called it.

Thripp began with what he called a “harmless demonstration,” feeding in:

```haskell
square x = x * x
result = square 5
print result
```

The machine regarded the request with the languid apathy of a cat receiving an instruction from an unimportant personage. Nothing happened. Holmes raised his brows. Thripp, after some embarrassment, explained that the computation would occur only “when needed.” The machine continued to do nothing until Thripp shook the Laziness Cylinder, whereupon it reluctantly whispered **25** with a sigh of philosophical resignation.

Next Thripp attempted to demonstrate purity:

```haskell
x = 3
x = 10  -- forbidden
```

The Purity Boiler exploded in a hiss of moral outrage, printing a denunciation so verbose it could have served as the preface to a sermon. Sugden wisely took cover.

At last, Thripp approached the Monad Engine with solemnity, declaring that he would unveil the “true heart” of Whiskell. He inserted the following scroll:

```haskell
main = do
    putStrLn "Hello"
    putStrLn "World"
```

Instantly the machine stiffened. The IO interaction, Thripp explained, was “impure” and therefore must be “wrapped” in a monad. Holmes whispered that he had always suspected monads were merely elaborate containers for doing what machines had done naturally since Babbage.

The machine performed the output, though only after issuing an elaborate apology for its impurity and for troubling the operator with observable effects. It printed **Hello** and **World**, each followed by a sanctifying parenthetical note that seemed to indicate regret.

Holmes turned to Thripp and asked whether the machine intended always to preface common actions with theological disclaimers. Before Thripp could answer, he was overtaken by the Monad Curse and became hopelessly unable to continue his own explanation.

Finally, in a gesture that would later be described as reckless, Thripp attempted to demonstrate how Whiskell could, when necessary, bypass its own purity. He inserted:

```haskell
let x = unsafePerformIO (readFile "notes.txt")
print (take 10 x)
```

The instant the machine perceived **unsafePerformIO**, its tranquillity evaporated like steam from an overheated pipe. The Purity Boiler shrieked, the Laziness Cylinder recoiled from the sudden encounter with real data, and the Monad Engine twisted its own pipes into shapes no engineer had intended.

The machine protested that reality had been summoned in violation of its philosophical framework, printed **FATAL ERROR: IMPURITY HAS ESCAPED**, and shut itself down in an act of mechanical despair.

Sugden later insisted he felt the floorboards tremble.

Holmes’s formal report, delivered the following morning with an air of resignation, read as follows:

> **Report on the P.P.A. Mark VIII (Whiskell)**
> 
> The Mark VIII is a machine whose pursuit of purity has led it into a state of moral paralysis. Its laziness ensures that nothing is done promptly, if indeed anything is done at all. Its immutability renders correction impossible. Above all, its reliance upon monads—a concept apparently comprehensible only at the moment when it becomes indescribable—makes it unsuitable for any environment in which clarity or progress is desired.
> 
> I conclude that Whiskell is admirably suited for monasteries, academies of abstract philosophy, and other institutions where inactivity is indistinguishable from contemplation.
> 
> — S. Holmes, Consultant
# **Afterword**

Professor Thripp, restored to enthusiasm after only a short interval, now proposes a **Mark IX**, which he claims shall distribute purity across many machines simultaneously—an idea Holmes describes as “the exportation of inefficiency on an industrial scale.” Sugden has quietly informed me that he will attend no further demonstrations unless they take place outdoors and preferably behind a blast shield.

As for myself, I remain convinced that any machine which places philosophy above practicality, purity above usefulness, and monads above all else is destined never to compute anything except its own regret.

# **Holmes’s Closing Monologue at the Chloratic Society Fireplace**

_Set down by Horace Pennington, F.C.S._

It was some evenings after the lamentable retirement of the Mark VIII that I found myself seated in the great leather chairs of the Chloratic Society’s reading-room, the crackle of the fire providing a civilized accompaniment to the introspection of the hour. Holmes, whose mood was neither melancholy nor triumphant but something hovering alertly between the two, warmed his hands at the hearth with a deliberation that suggested he intended to deliver an opinion of general application. I took out my notebook unobtrusively.

“My dear Pennington,” Holmes began, “these pneumatic engines of Professor Thripp have weighed on my mind, not merely on account of their individual absurdities—which have been numerous and creatively distributed—but because they have illustrated, with nearly experimental clarity, a tendency among engineers of our era which I cannot but consider hazardous both to good sense and to the public safety.”

He settled deeper into the chair, which creaked in a manner that conveyed sympathy.

“You see,” he continued, “the trouble does not lie in the machines being ill-conceived from the outset. Each Mark, taken alone, began from an idea with every promise. The misfortune lies in the engineer falling in love with that one idea, fastening upon it with a loyalty more suited to marriage than to mechanical invention, and thereafter refusing to admit the existence of any alternative approach. From that moment, complexity accumulates around the notion like barnacles on the hull of a neglected ship. The machine acquires valves that contradict its original purpose, boilers that scold the operator, dials that hint at theological ambitions, and finally some ungainly contrivance—called a monad, perhaps—which tries to solve a problem no sensible person ever had.”

Holmes gestured with his pipe toward the rows of engineering journals lining the walls. “It is not that alternatives fail to exist, Pennington; it is that once a man decides his one principle must reign supreme, alternatives cease to be worth entertaining. He proceeds as though any admission that another design might serve is a personal defeat. And so, instead of stepping back, he strides forward, piling curlicue upon curlicue of needless complication, erecting a cathedral around a teapot, until the entire enterprise becomes incapable of pouring so much as a cup.”

He paused, struck a fresh match, and lit the pipe with an air of grim satisfaction.

“And then,” Holmes said thoughtfully, “comes the moment when the engineer, surrounded by his pipes, gauges, regulators, condensers, decanters, counter-decanters, and auxiliary counter-counter-decanters, insists that the machine’s failure is not due to its thousand superfluous appendages, but because the rest of us have ‘not truly understood it.’ That is the hour in which you may safely wager the contrivance is about to explode.”

Here Holmes gave me a warning glance, as if anticipating my future behaviour. “If ever you see an engineer maintaining that a mechanism is elegant precisely because you do not comprehend it, stand well back. And if he begins to declare that elegance lies in its very difficulty, flee.”

At that moment, Holmes seemed prepared to rest his case—but instead leaned forward, adopting a tone so grave that the flicker of the fire appeared to dim out of respect.

“But I am not yet done, Pennington. For there is a second danger, not merely of clinging to one idea, nor of loading that idea with excessive elaborations, but rather of drifting into an intellectual region I can only describe as perilous to the sanity of mankind. I refer, of course, to what some call ‘type theory.’ A region,” he said, drawing on his pipe, “where even the boldest engineers may become lost among symbols and constraints until they no longer recall whether they are designing a machine or attempting to classify every pigeon in Christendom.”

And with that, he leaned back, exhaling a plume of smoke that curled upward like a diagram whose meaning had been forgotten by its draftsman.


# **Epilogue: The Catastrophe of the P.P.A. Mark Ω**

_Set down by Horace Pennington, Fellow of the Chloratic Society_

In the weeks that followed Sherlock Holmes’s memorable monologue by the fire—those reflections upon the peculiar tendency of engineers to seize upon one idea, cling to it like a drowning man to a plank, and thereafter pile refinement upon refinement until the plank becomes an over-decorated raft and finally a sinking galleon—Professor Osmond Thripp was seen wandering the premises of the Chloratic Society with a look that combined inspiration, secrecy, and the faintly glazed expression of one who has been awake far too long in the company of valves.

It was soon whispered among the membership that the Professor, having reflected profoundly upon the varied fortunes of the Mark I through the Mark VIII—each a distinct design taken too far, rather than a proper series—had resolved to produce what he called the *ultimate synthesis*, a machine that would surpass all others in power, capability, and general intimidation.

Holmes, upon hearing this, merely said, “My dear Pennington, whenever an engineer declares that he is building ‘the ultimate machine,’ prudence demands that one make certain one’s will is in order.”

And in due course, Thripp unveiled his creation.

The machine—christened by Thripp as the **Pneumatic Processing Apparatus, Mark Ω**—was unveiled in the Great Demonstration Hall beneath a tarpaulin of theatrical proportions. When this covering was whisked away with injudicious enthusiasm, the membership gasped, for the contrivance resembled not a coherent engine but the entire contents of an ironmonger’s shop swept together by a minor landslide. There were boilers upon boilers, lawful pipes tangled among disreputable pipes, wheels whose purpose was not immediately clear, valves labelled “Legacy,” “Enhancement,” “Do Not Use,” and “Used Internally,” and, most disturbingly of all, a collection of smaller machines evidently bolted on in hopes that they might be useful someday for reasons not yet foreseen.

Thripp’s accompanying language—named **See±±**, pronounced “See More or Less,” though it was invariably understood as “See Plus or Minus”—was introduced with trembling pride. He claimed it combined the strength of Sea, the safety of Zest, the conceptual purity of Whiskell, and the efficiency of numerous unnamed influences drawn from experiments he had conducted “in private.” Holmes murmured that any machine combining so many unrelated virtues was likely to exhibit them only in theory, much like a soufflé containing every ingredient in the larder.

Thripp insisted that See±± allowed for Pointers, should one prefer danger, References, should one prefer discipline, Templates, should one prefer massive explosions in the complexity boiler, Multiple dispatch, which Thripp described but could not demonstrate, Operator Overloading, which Holmes said was “the first step toward madness,” and mixing everything with everything, which appeared to be the language’s chief guiding principle.

Holmes likened it to “teaching a rhinoceros ballet, solely because one has already taught it to wear a hat.”

When Thripp fed the first program into the Mark Ω, an atmosphere of mingled fear and fascination settled over the hall. The tape contained a single, innocent line:

```cpp
auto x = 5;
```

The machine accepted this, though with a faint rattling that suggested philosophical unease.

Encouraged, Thripp attempted:

```cpp
template <typename T>
T square(T v) { return v * v; }
```

The Template Chamber activated with a roar like a lion being asked to classify itself taxonomically. New pipes emerged from side compartments that none of us had previously seen; several gauges spun in opposite directions; the machine made a sound that, in human terms, would have been a sigh of resignation.

At last, Thripp attempted to combine pointers, templates, operator overloading, and a mysterious mechanism he called “the Meta-Boiler,” by inserting:

```cpp
auto p = new Fancy<int>(7);
print(*p + p->value());
```

This was the point at which the machine rebelled. The Deference Valve wobbled; the Generic Overpressure Tank howled; the Meta-Boiler flashed sigils that no known safety inspector had authorized; and the entire contraption emitted a philosophical shriek, half steam and half despair.

The Mark Ω printed:

> **AMBIGUITY DETECTED. MULTIPLE OVERLOADS APPLY. NONE ARE SUITABLE. ALL ARE VALID. ALL ARE INVALID.**

Then, after a prolonged shudder:

> **FATAL ERROR: TOO MANY FEATURES.**

A final puff of steam ascended, like the soul of a departed kettle, and the Mark Ω became as still as a tombstone. One member swore he saw the Meta-Boiler sink in on itself like a collapsed star.

Holmes, stepping forward with the melancholy steadiness of a man whose pessimism has once again been vindicated, pronounced:

“Professor Thripp, your Mark Ω is a monument to the idea that one must never abandon a mechanism once embraced, but instead continue adding to it until the original point is long forgotten. You have achieved, in short, a device which can do anything except the thing desired, and can represent everything except clarity.”

Thripp, to his credit, accepted this with grace, though he could be heard afterward muttering that See±± might be improved by “just one more feature.”

Holmes whispered to me, “My dear Pennington, if ever you hear an engineer utter those words, take shelter immediately.”
## **Conclusion of the Entire Affair**

Thus ends the long chronicle of the pneumatic engines—from the runaway enthusiasm of the Mark I to the metaphysical pretensions of the Mark VIII, and finally to the catastrophic ambition of the Mark Ω. Each machine was distinct in principle, unique in folly, and ruinous in execution; each was a testament not to the perfection of engineering, but to the engineer’s fatal attraction to complexity for its own sake. If this record serves no other purpose, may it at least guide future generations of the Chloratic Society to approach any device promising universality with enough skepticism to fill a boiler.

Holmes has advised me that the entire basement should be disinfected, ideally with fire.

And so I close this chronicle with the hope—however faint—that no gentleman of mechanical inclination shall attempt another such machine within my lifetime.
