# Foreword

Modern popular literary genres were not invented in the golden age of classical
literature, and there were never a Roman Arthur Conan Doyle or Stephen King.
A student of Latin seeking extensive reading material is stuck with Gallic wars
and lives of saints. But what if classical or mediaeval writers were more inventive?

_Stories Never Written_ is an attempt to use AI to produce Latin reading material
that would resonate better with the modern reader. Reading material is the word.
This is not great literature, and not even great Latin. The text is left
unaltered, minor grammatical mistakes and AI hallucinations intact.
