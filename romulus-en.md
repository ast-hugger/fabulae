# The Final Mystery of Romulus

## Chapter I: Rumor and Doubt

In the thirty-seventh year after the founding of the city, a wondrous rumor spread through all of Rome like wildfire: Romulus, founder and king of the city, had been taken by the god Mars, ascending into the heavens! The people, from the commoners to the senators, received this news in the streets and forums, some cheering in exultation, others shedding tears in reverence. The Senate itself confirmed this story with official declarations, asserting that Romulus had now become a god and would forever watch over his city.

I, Gaius Flavius, was recounting these events to my friend Marcus Terentius Crispus when I noticed a faint hint of doubt on his face. “Crispus,” I said, “does this not seem marvelous to you? I can imagine it now: Romulus, lifted through a break in the clouds, surrounded by flashes of light; the people prostrate on the ground, averting their eyes from the divine radiance. And since Marcellus himself, the tribune, claimed to have seen the cloud rise to the heavens, who could doubt it?”

Crispus, however, raised his gaze and fixed his perceptive eyes on me. In a low voice, he replied, “Flavius, the story is indeed remarkable, but why has it spread so quickly throughout the city? Nothing on its own could take root in public opinion so swiftly or with such unshakable confidence. Yet here we are, with all of Rome united in belief, as though no one could conceive of it being anything but the truth.”

Somewhat uncertain, I replied, “But surely this is a sign of divinity, Crispus—that with no delay, no hesitation, this vision is set firmly in the people’s minds.” Yet I noticed him watching me more closely, a faint, ironic smile barely concealed.

“Flavius,” he said, “Rome is inclined to believe rumors, but a sudden ascension like this, of their own king, would never have been so quickly accepted without some delay, unless the Senate itself had urged the people toward faith in it. There is no proof at all except the senators’ words. And none but those nearest to him in the Senate even saw this ‘ascension.’”

Crispus’s words made me uneasy; it was true, now that I considered it, that the Senate had proclaimed this story to the people so swiftly, so immediately, and so unanimously, almost as if to extinguish any questions in the minds of the people. Yet Crispus still smiled faintly, as though more were left unsaid.

After a brief silence, Crispus added, in a slightly more serious tone, “This, Flavius, which has been impressed so firmly upon the people, sounds to me less like the intervention of Mars and more like the craft of the Senate. If we seek not what is spoken but what is concealed, we may be led to the hidden truth.”
