# The Final Mystery of Romulus

## Chapter I: Rumor and Doubt

In the thirty-seventh year after the founding of the city, a wondrous rumor spread through all of Rome like wildfire: Romulus, founder and king of the city, had been taken by the god Mars, ascending into the heavens! The people, from the commoners to the senators, received this news in the streets and forums, some cheering in exultation, others shedding tears in reverence. The Senate itself confirmed this story with official declarations, asserting that Romulus had now become a god and would forever watch over his city.

I, Gaius Flavius, was recounting these events to my friend Marcus Terentius Crispus when I noticed a faint hint of doubt on his face. “Crispus,” I said, “does this not seem marvelous to you? I can imagine it now: Romulus, lifted through a break in the clouds, surrounded by flashes of light; the people prostrate on the ground, averting their eyes from the divine radiance. And since Marcellus himself, the tribune, claimed to have seen the cloud rise to the heavens, who could doubt it?”

Crispus, however, raised his gaze and fixed his perceptive eyes on me. In a low voice, he replied, “Flavius, the story is indeed remarkable, but why has it spread so quickly throughout the city? Nothing on its own could take root in public opinion so swiftly or with such unshakable confidence. Yet here we are, with all of Rome united in belief, as though no one could conceive of it being anything but the truth.”

Somewhat uncertain, I replied, “But surely this is a sign of divinity, Crispus—that with no delay, no hesitation, this vision is set firmly in the people’s minds.” Yet I noticed him watching me more closely, a faint, ironic smile barely concealed.

“Flavius,” he said, “Rome is inclined to believe rumors, but a sudden ascension like this, of their own king, would never have been so quickly accepted without some delay, unless the Senate itself had urged the people toward faith in it. There is no proof at all except the senators’ words. And none but those nearest to him in the Senate even saw this ‘ascension.’”

Crispus’s words made me uneasy; it was true, now that I considered it, that the Senate had proclaimed this story to the people so swiftly, so immediately, and so unanimously, almost as if to extinguish any questions in the minds of the people. Yet Crispus still smiled faintly, as though more were left unsaid.

After a brief silence, Crispus added, in a slightly more serious tone, “This, Flavius, which has been impressed so firmly upon the people, sounds to me less like the intervention of Mars and more like the craft of the Senate. If we seek not what is spoken but what is concealed, we may be led to the hidden truth.”

## Chapter II: The Beginning of the Investigation

Afterward, as dawn broke with the arrival of a new day, Crispus and I, now filled with suspicion and concern, set out to Campus Martius. This place, vast and beautiful, was full of history and glorious deeds. Here, once, the Roman army would gather for games and celebrations, and in its midst, the temples of the gods would rise prominently. The shade of the trees and the sweet fragrance of the air now stirred doubt and anxiety in our hearts.

We arrived at the spot where Romulus, according to the rumor, ascended to the heavens. The ground was covered with grasses and flowers, but there were neither clouds nor heavenly portals visible that would indicate his ascension. Nothing was apparent there, only the beauty of nature, which both attracted and troubled our minds.

Crispus, with a serene expression and keen eyes, leaned down to examine the ground, scrutinizing the tracks and traces in the earth. “If this happened here, Flavi,” he said, “perhaps the traces of some person or certain signs will reveal themselves to us.” I saw his gaze fixed on the ground, and I was prepared for a long observation.

The area was surrounded by large trees, and the wind softly rustled among the leafy branches. Crispus studied the remnants of the place as he perceived some scattered leaves and grasses. Soon, leaning closer to the ground, his eye was caught by something unusual. Among the grasses and leaves appeared a piece of beautiful purple cloth, discarded on the ground. “Look here, Flavi!” he exclaimed. “Something is being concealed from us. See what this is!”

Crispus followed the trace, and nearby in a small hollow, visible signs of a struggle appeared: a broken branch, trampled grasses, and disturbed earth. “Surely something serious happened here,” Crispus said, his expression reflecting suspicion.

As hidden shadows lurked between the bushes, Crispus began to question passersby who were coming to the games and festivities. Among them was a youth named Marcus, the son of a farmer, who approached us and said, “I have indeed heard about the ascension of Romulus, but it was merely an empty clamor and joy. I stood in the crowd, yet saw nothing except people shouting.”

Crispus, upon hearing this, raised his eyes, and thoughts quickly revolved in his mind. “The youth says,” he remarked, “that this could only be a rumor shouted forth, as there was no witness. Perhaps something in the ground leads us away from this tale.” He questioned the young man about nearby places, and by the end of the conversation, he directed him to the water that flowed through Campus Martius.

There, on the riverbank, Crispus began to examine carefully. The traces, numerous from the grass and bare earth, revealed another matter. “There,” he said, “you can see. Not only the traces but also signs that seemed to weep upon the earth. Perhaps something was left behind here.”

Crispus then moved through other paths and came to an open view where other spectators who had dined were gathering to celebrate. There, he heard from an old man named Lucius, who had spent his entire life in Campus Martius, and approaching him, Crispus asked, “What do you know about the ascension of Romulus? Did you see this happen?”

Lucius, with a very sad expression, replied, “I was not part of it, but I hear many things. Those who are together with the Senate keep this truth hidden in darkness.”

When Crispus heard this, his spirit became more resolute. He placed diligence and thought into his investigation. All these signs indicated that something obscure was being concealed; while some traces seemed to lead us, the truth itself remained hidden, dark and inaccessible.

After much inquiry, Crispus sat beneath the shade of a tree and, contemplating in his mind, considered what was just. “Flavi,” he said, “this brings not only an incredible tale; rather, wisdom yields a better release. The truth seems to hide here, and I shall watch over it, perhaps in vain.”

## Chapter III: Valerius and the Truth

After Crispus had reached his investigation in Campus Martius, a plan quickly formed in his mind. “Flavi,” he said, “it seems reasonable to speak with Valerius, the senator. His testimony about Romulus’s ascension could aid us in this inquiry. Some sense must be gleaned from this.”

So we set out for Valerius’s house. The place was beautiful, adorned with statues and ornaments that illustrated the glory of the Roman people. When we entered, Valerius, an elderly and serious man, welcomed us with a kindly spirit. “Greetings, friends! What brings you to me?”

Crispus, with a serene face, replied, “Senator, having heard about Romulus’s ascension, we cannot help but seek the truth. Many rumors circulate about this matter. Will you speak to us about it?”

Valerius, with shining golden eyes, smiled and said, “What troubles you, Crispus? All these are mere rumors, but the truth is eternal. Romulus, a god himself, ascended to the stars, so that eternal favor might be granted to the Roman people. You should not dwell in doubts.”

“But senator,” Crispus interjected, gently probing, “can you not say why no one saw him ascend? Such events are often witnessed by many, yet we have no witness, except your word alone.”

Valerius, tilting his face slightly, replied, “Crispus, not every truth must be known. This is a divine mystery. All things are provided for, and our Romulus, now in heaven, watches over us and grants us protection.”

Crispus, sitting with an attentive face, clearly felt Valerius’s arguments were becoming less sound. “But to me,” he said, “most diligently, what is seen does not yield testimony, even though he has ascended to heaven. Your people ought to question this and not believe in mysteries that lie hidden in darkness.”

Valerius, with a stern look, insisted, “Crispus, you must not linger in ambiguity. The ascension of Romulus is a divine matter, and those who speak against it are enveloped in envy and curses from adversaries.”

Upon hearing this, Crispus raised his face, turned to me, and said softly, “Flavi, something here does not fit. Valerius presents his speech as truth, but his reasons do not withstand investigation. Do you not see what is happening in the shadows?”

I, somewhat confused, murmured, “But if the senate affirms this, perhaps the truth lies within it.”

“It is not the truth that is presented,” Crispus replied. “All who seek the truth in heaven risk danger, and the eyes of the senate, it seems, do not care; they bring forth no truth at all. Perhaps his words are uncertain, and the matters prepared for us come from the other side. Much lies hidden in darkness.”
