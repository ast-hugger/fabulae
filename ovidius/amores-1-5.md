*It was hot, and the day had driven past its middle hour; I laid my weary limbs on the middle of the bed. One part of the window was open, the other part closed; just as woods typically have a certain kind of light, like twilight gleams when Phoebus is fleeing, or when night has gone but day has not yet risen.*

- exigere (exegerat) - to drive out, complete, pass through (pluperfect)
- adponere (adposui) - to place near, lay down upon
- levandus - requiring relief, needing rest (gerundive)
- adapertus - partially open
- sublucere - to gleam faintly, shine dimly
- fugere - to flee, hasten away (used poetically of the setting sun)
- orior (orta) - to rise, emerge, be born

The passage evokes a common scene from Roman daily life during the hottest part of the day. The "middle hour" refers to the sixth hour by Roman reckoning, around noon. Romans, like other Mediterranean peoples, often rested during these hot hours. Windows in Roman houses were typically openings that could be covered with wooden shutters or cloth, lacking glass panes as we know them. The poetic personification of the sun as Phoebus (Apollo) was a standard literary device. The description of half-light creates a dreamy atmosphere between sleep and wakefulness. The torus was a Roman couch or bed, often placed in a cubiculum (bedroom), and would have been elevated on legs with a stuffed mattress. The careful observation of natural light conditions reflects the importance of daylight in a pre-industrial society where artificial lighting was limited to oil lamps and candles.
> illa verecundis lux est praebenda puellis,<br/>
> qua timidus latebras speret habere pudor.<br/>
> ecce, Corinna venit, tunica velata recincta,<br/>
> candida dividua colla tegente coma—<br/>
> qualiter in thalamos famosa Semiramis isse<br/>
> dicitur, et multis Lais amata viris.<br/>

*That light must be provided for modest girls, in which timid modesty might hope to have hiding places. Look! Corinna comes, veiled in an ungirded tunic, her white neck covered by parted hair—just as the famous Semiramis is said to have gone to her chambers, and Lais, beloved by many men.*

- verecundus, -a, -um - modest, bashful, shy
- praebere - to offer, provide, furnish
- latebra, -ae (f.) - hiding place, retreat (here plural)
- velatus, -a, -um - veiled, covered
- recinctus, -a, -um - ungirded, loosely bound
- dividuus, -a, -um - divided, parted
- collum, -i (n.) - neck
- thalamus, -i (m.) - bedchamber, marriage bed
- qualiter - just as, in what way

The passage contains several cultural references that require explanation. The mention of "modest girls" and "timid modesty" reflects Roman social values regarding female virtue and propriety. The description of clothing is significant: the "ungirded tunic" (tunica recincta) suggests a state of undress, as women typically wore their tunics belted. Parted hair falling over the neck was considered sensual in Roman culture.

Semiramis was a legendary Assyrian queen known for her beauty and power, often associated with luxury and seduction in classical literature. Lais refers to one of two famous Greek courtesans of that name (from Corinth or Hyccara), known for their extraordinary beauty and numerous lovers among the elite. Both historical references would have been immediately recognized by educated Roman readers as examples of famously seductive women, setting up a complex interplay between modesty and sensuality in the passage.

The attention to lighting conditions reflects Roman architectural concerns with privacy, as most Roman houses had few windows and carefully controlled light for both practical and social reasons.
> Deripui tunicam—nec multum rara nocebat;<br/>
> pugnabat tunica sed tamen illa tegi.<br/>
> quae cum ita pugnaret, tamquam quae vincere nollet,<br/>
> victa est non aegre proditione sua.<br/>
> ut stetit ante oculos posito velamine nostros,<br/>
> in toto nusquam corpore menda fuit.<br/>

*I tore off her tunic—though being sheer it wasn't much hindrance; yet that tunic fought to stay in place. Though she fought thus, as one who didn't wish to win, she was easily conquered by her own betrayal. When she stood before our eyes with her covering removed, there was not a single flaw anywhere on her body.*

- deripere - to tear off, snatch away (deripui - perfect)
- rarus, -a, -um - thin, loose, scattered, rare
- nocere - to harm, hinder, be troublesome
- proditio, -onis (f.) - betrayal, treachery
- velamen, -inis (n.) - covering, garment, veil
- menda, -ae (f.) - fault, blemish, defect
- nusquam - nowhere, in no place
- aegre - with difficulty, reluctantly (non aegre - easily)

This passage describes the removal of a woman's tunic, a basic garment in Roman dress. The tunica was a simple, knee-length garment worn by both men and women, though women's versions were typically longer. The description of it as "rara" (sheer) suggests it was made of fine, possibly imported fabric like silk or very thin wool, which was considered luxurious. The theme of mock resistance ("pugnare") was a common literary trope in Roman love poetry, reflecting complex attitudes toward female sexuality and consent in Roman society. The detailed attention to the absence of physical flaws ("menda") reflects Roman aesthetic ideals and the culture's emphasis on physical beauty. The scene's intimate nature is characteristic of Roman elegiac poetry, which often dealt with private, erotic themes that would have been shocking to more conservative Romans.
> quos umeros, quales vidi tetigique lacertos!<br/>
> forma papillarum quam fuit apta premi!<br/>
> quam castigato planus sub pectore venter!<br/>
> quantum et quale latus! quam iuvenale femur!<br/>
> Singula quid referam? nil non laudabile vidi<br/>
> et nudam pressi corpus ad usque meum.<br/>

*What shoulders, what arms I saw and touched! How suitable was the shape of her breasts to be caressed! How flat her stomach beneath her trim chest! What a side, both in size and beauty! How youthful her thigh! Why should I describe each detail? I saw nothing that was not praiseworthy, and I pressed her naked body right against mine.*

- umerus, -i (m.) - shoulder
- lacertus, -i (m.) - upper arm, muscle
- papilla, -ae (f.) - breast, nipple
- castigatus, -a, -um - controlled, trim, disciplined
- planus, -a, -um - flat, level, smooth
- femur, femoris (n.) - thigh
- singula, -orum (n. pl.) - individual items, details
- laudabilis, -e - praiseworthy, commendable
- usque (adv.) - continuously, all the way, right up to
- premere - to press, squeeze, caress (in erotic contexts)

The passage is an example of Latin erotic poetry, following conventions of the genre in its detailed description of the female form. The aesthetic ideals described reflect Roman standards of beauty: a trim, athletic figure was considered attractive. The term "castigatus" for the chest suggests controlled, well-proportioned features rather than excess. The progression of the description follows a traditional top-to-bottom pattern common in ancient literature. The frank sensuality of the piece is characteristic of Roman love poetry, which was more explicit than most modern poetry. The first-person narrative voice and the present recollection of a past encounter is a typical device of Roman elegiac poetry. The mention of pressing bodies together (premere) uses a common euphemism in Latin erotic vocabulary.
> Cetera quis nescit? lassi requievimus ambo.<br/>
> proveniant medii sic mihi saepe dies!<br/>

*Who doesn't know the rest? We both rested, exhausted. May my midday hours often turn out this way!*

- lassus, -a, -um - tired, weary, exhausted
- requiescere - to rest, repose (requievimus - perfect tense)
- ambo, -ae, -o - both
- provenire - to come forth, turn out, result (proveniant - present subjunctive)
- medius dies - midday, noon (literally "middle day")

The passage refers to events during the middle of the day, which was a common time for rest in Roman society. The siesta culture was well-established in ancient Rome, particularly during the hot summer months when many activities would pause during the warmest hours. The use of "ambo" (both) suggests an intimate scene between two people, while the rhetorical question "cetera quis nescit?" ("who doesn't know the rest?") is a literary device known as aposiopesis - a deliberate trailing off that leaves the unsaid to the reader's imagination. This was a common technique in Roman love poetry. The subjunctive mood in "proveniant" expresses a wish or hope for future occasions, another typical feature of Roman poetry. The reference to midday (medii dies) reflects the Roman division of the day into twelve hours between sunrise and sunset, with the sixth hour corresponding to noon.
