> Non ego nobilium sedeo studiosus equorum;<br/>
> cui tamen ipsa faves, vincat ut ille, precor.<br/>
> ut loquerer tecum veni, tecumque sederem,<br/>
> ne tibi non notus, quem facis, esset amor.<br/>

*I do not sit here as an enthusiast of noble horses; yet I pray that the one whom you yourself favor may win. I came to talk with you and to sit beside you, so that the love you inspire would not be unknown to you.*

- studiosus, -a, -um (+ gen.) - eager for, devoted to, fond of
- nobilis, -e - noble, well-known, high-born
- favere (+ dat.) - to favor, support, be well disposed to
- precari - to pray, beseech, entreat
- loqui (deponent) - to speak, converse (loquerer - imperfect subjunctive)
- notus, -a, -um - known, familiar, notable

The passage takes place at a horse race in a Roman circus or hippodrome, a major venue for public entertainment in ancient Rome. Horse racing was one of the most popular spectator sports, drawing huge crowds from all social classes. The "noble horses" (nobilium equorum) refers to thoroughbred racing horses, which were highly valued and often had their genealogies carefully recorded. The practice of favoring particular horses or teams was common - spectators would often passionately support their favorites, similar to modern sports fans. The social aspect of these events was significant - the circus served as a meeting place where people could socialize, and as suggested in the passage, even pursue romantic interests. The speaker's admission that he's not particularly interested in the horses, but rather in his companion's company, reflects the circus's role as a social venue beyond mere entertainment.
> tu cursus spectas, ego te; spectemus uterque<br/>
> quod iuvat, atque oculos pascat uterque suos.<br/>
> o, cuicumque faves, felix agitator equorum!<br/>
> ergo illi curae contigit esse tuae?<br/>

*You watch the races, I watch you; let each of us watch what pleases us, and let each feed their own eyes. O fortunate charioteer, whoever you favor! So has it happened that he is the object of your attention?*

- spectare - to watch, observe, look at (intensive form of specere)
- uterque, utraque, utrumque - each (of two), both
- pascere - to feed, nourish (pascat - present subjunctive)
- agitator, -oris (m.) - driver, charioteer
- contingere - to happen, befall, turn out (contigit - perfect)
- cura, -ae (f.) - care, concern, attention

The passage describes a scene at a Roman chariot race in the circus (stadium). Chariot racing was the most popular spectator sport in ancient Rome, drawing massive crowds to venues like the Circus Maximus. Charioteers were celebrities of their time, often acquiring fame and fortune despite their typically low social status as slaves or freedmen. They raced for different teams or "factions," identified by colors (most commonly Blue, Green, Red, and White), and fans would passionately support their preferred faction and drivers. The term "agitator equorum" (driver of horses) was a formal title for these professional charioteers. The poem captures a common social dynamic at Roman spectacles, where the events were as much about watching others and being seen as about the entertainment itself. The speaker's romantic interest in someone who is focused on the charioteer reflects the circus's role as a place for social interaction and courtship in Roman society.
> hoc mihi contingat, sacro de carcere missis<br/>
> insistam forti mente vehendus equis,<br/>
> et modo lora dabo, modo verbere terga notabo,<br/>
> nunc stringam metas interiore rota.<br/>

*May this happen to me: that I shall mount horses released from the sacred starting gate, to be carried with brave spirit, and now I shall give them reins, now I shall mark their backs with the whip, and now I shall graze the turning posts with my inner wheel.*

- contingere - to happen, befall, touch (contingat - present subjunctive)
- carcer, carceris (m.) - starting gate, prison
- insistere - to stand upon, mount, press on
- vehendus - gerundive of veho (to carry, convey)
- lorum, -i (n.) - rein, strap (lora - plural)
- verber, -eris (n.) - whip, lash, blow
- tergum, -i (n.) - back (terga - plural)
- notare - to mark, brand, observe
- stringere - to graze, touch lightly
- meta, -ae (f.) - turning post, goal post
- interior, -ius - inner, interior

The passage describes chariot racing in the Roman circus. The carcer was the starting gate where chariots waited before the race began. It was considered "sacred" as races had religious significance and were often part of religious festivals. The metae were three conical posts at each end of the circus around which chariots had to turn - a dangerous maneuver requiring great skill. Grazing the meta with the inner wheel was a sign of expert driving, as taking too wide a turn would lose time, while hitting the post could be fatal. The description of alternating between giving slack to the reins and using the whip reflects actual chariot-racing technique. The four-horse racing chariot (quadriga) was the most prestigious form of racing in Roman times. Racing success could bring enormous fame and wealth to charioteers, who were often slaves or freedmen.
> si mihi currenti fueris conspecta, morabor,<br/>
> deque meis manibus lora remissa fluent.<br/>
> at quam paene Pelops Pisaea concidit hasta,<br/>
> dum spectat vultus, Hippodamia, tuos!<br/>
> nempe favore suae vicit tamen ille puellae.<br/>
> vincamus dominae quisque favore suae!<br/>

*If you should be glimpsed by me as I race, I will pause, and the loosened reins will slip from my hands. But how nearly did Pelops fall by the Pisaean spear, while gazing at your face, Hippodamia! Yet surely he won through his girl's favor. Let each of us win through the favor of his mistress!*

- conspicere (conspectus) - to catch sight of, observe
- lorum, -i (n.) - rein, strap (usually plural)
- remissus - loosened, slack, relaxed
- fluere - to flow, stream, slip
- concidere - to fall down, collapse
- nempe - certainly, obviously, of course
- favor, -oris (m.) - favor, support
- domina, -ae (f.) - mistress, lady (in elegiac poetry)

The passage alludes to the famous myth of Pelops and Hippodamia. Oenomaus, king of Pisa in Elis, challenged all suitors of his daughter Hippodamia to a chariot race, killing those he defeated. Pelops won the race (and Hippodamia's hand) through trickery, though here the victory is attributed to the favor of his beloved. The Pisaean spear refers to Oenomaus's weapon, as he would pursue and kill the suitors during the race. The scenario of racing chariots was a common one in ancient mythology and sport, where the handling of horses and control of reins required great skill. The final line employs a common theme in Roman love poetry where the poet draws a parallel between mythological examples and his own romantic situation.
> Quid frustra refugis? cogit nos linea iungi.<br/>
> haec in lege loci commoda circus habet —<br/>
> tu tamen a dextra, quicumque es, parce puellae;<br/>
> contactu lateris laeditur ista tui.<br/>

*Why do you try to escape in vain? The line forces us to sit together. The circus offers these advantages in the law of the place — yet you, whoever you are, spare the girl on your right; she is hurt by the touch of your side.*

- refugere - to flee back, retreat, escape
- cogere - to force, compel, gather together
- linea, -ae (f.) - line, string, boundary marker
- iungere - to join, unite, connect
- commodum, -i (n.) - advantage, convenience, benefit
- parcere (+ dat.) - to spare, refrain from harming
- contactus, -us (m.) - touch, contact
- latus, lateris (n.) - side, flank
- laedere - to hurt, harm, damage

The passage describes a scene in the Roman circus, a venue for chariot races and other spectacles. The "line" (linea) refers to the marked seating spaces on the stone benches where spectators sat. Roman entertainment venues had designated seating arrangements regulated by law (lex loci), with people packed closely together on long benches. This was particularly true after Augustus instituted social seating regulations. The poem appears to be addressing someone who is attempting to avoid sitting close to others, while simultaneously warning them about proper behavior toward women in these crowded conditions. The concern about unwanted physical contact reflects both the crowded nature of Roman public entertainments and social propriety regarding physical contact between strangers, especially involving women. The circus could hold tens of thousands of spectators, making close physical proximity inevitable.
> tu quoque, qui spectas post nos, tua contrahe crura,<br/>
> si pudor est, rigido nec preme terga genu!<br/>
> sed nimium demissa iacent tibi pallia terra.<br/>
> collige — vel digitis en ego tollo meis!<br/>

*You too, who are sitting behind us, draw in your legs, if you have any sense of shame, and don't press against our backs with your stiff knee! But your cloak is lying too low on the ground. Gather it up — or look, I'll pick it up with my own fingers!*

- contrahere - to draw together, contract, gather in
- crura, -um (n. pl.) - legs, shins
- pudor, -oris (m.) - shame, sense of propriety, decency
- rigidus, -a, -um - stiff, hard, inflexible
- tergum, -i (n.) - back, rear
- demissus, -a, -um - lowered, hanging down, drooping
- pallia, -orum (n. pl.) - cloaks, mantles
- colligere - to gather up, collect
- en - look! behold! (interjection)

The passage describes a scene in what is likely a crowded Roman theater or amphitheater, where spectators sat on long stone benches arranged in tiers. Personal space was limited, and proper behavior was important for comfortable coexistence. The pallium was a Roman cloak worn draped over the body, similar to a Greek himation. The speaker is complaining about someone sitting in the row behind who is being inconsiderate in two ways: pressing their knees against the speaker's back, and letting their cloak trail down too far. The reference to pudor (sense of shame or propriety) indicates that such inconsiderate behavior was seen as a breach of social etiquette. The threat to handle someone else's clothing would have been particularly forward, as touching another's garments without permission was generally considered presumptuous in Roman society.
> invida vestis eras, quae tam bona crura tegebas;<br/>
> quoque magis spectes — invida vestis eras!<br/>
> talia Milanion Atalantes crura fugacis<br/>
> optavit manibus sustinuisse suis.<br/>

*You were an envious garment, which covered such beautiful legs; and the more one might look - you were an envious garment! Such were the legs of swift Atalanta that Milanion wished to hold in his hands.*

- invidus, -a, -um - envious, jealous, grudging
- tegere - to cover, conceal, hide (tegebas - imperfect)
- spectare - to look at, watch, observe
- fugax, fugacis - swift, fleeting, prone to flight
- optare - to wish for, desire, choose
- sustinere - to hold up, support, sustain (sustinuisse - perfect infinitive)

The passage makes reference to the myth of Atalanta and Milanion (also known as Hippomenes in some versions). Atalanta was a legendary huntress who was famous for her incredible speed in running. She would challenge her suitors to a footrace, with marriage as the prize for victory but death as the penalty for defeat. Milanion/Hippomenes won her hand by using golden apples given to him by Aphrodite to distract Atalanta during the race. The description of her legs as "bona crura" and the mention of her swiftness (fugacis) emphasizes her athletic nature. The poem playfully personifies a garment as being "envious" for hiding Atalanta's legs from view, reflecting common themes in Roman love poetry where clothing is often portrayed as an unwelcome barrier between lover and beloved. The format and theme are characteristic of Latin elegiac poetry, which often incorporated mythological exempla into personal romantic contexts.
> talia pinguntur succinctae crura Dianae<br/>
> cum sequitur fortes, fortior ipsa, feras.<br/>
> his ego non visis arsi; quid fiet ab ipsis?<br/>
> in flammam flammas, in mare fundis aquas.<br/>

*Such are painted the legs of girt-up Diana when she, herself braver, pursues brave beasts. I burned without even seeing these; what will happen from seeing them directly? You pour flames into fire, water into the sea.*

- succingere - to gird up, tuck up (clothing)
- crus, cruris (n.) - leg, shin
- fortis, -e - brave, strong
- fera, -ae (f.) - wild animal, beast
- ardere - to burn, be on fire (arsi - perfect)
- fundere - to pour, scatter, spread

The passage makes reference to Diana (Greek Artemis), the virgin goddess of hunting. In classical art and literature, she was typically depicted wearing a short tunic hitched up (succincta) to allow freedom of movement while hunting. This practical dress style contrasted with the longer, more restrictive clothing worn by Roman women in daily life. The image of Diana as a huntress pursuing wild beasts was a common motif in Roman art, particularly in wall paintings and mosaics. The metaphorical language of fire and water draws on common Classical love poetry tropes, where passion is often described in terms of burning (ardere). The final line employs a proverbial expression about futility - adding water to the sea or fire to flames - which would have been familiar to Roman audiences. The structure moves from ekphrasis (description of artwork) to personal emotional response, a common rhetorical technique in Roman poetry.
> suspicor ex istis et cetera posse placere,<br/>
> quae bene sub tenui condita veste latent.<br/>
> Vis tamen interea faciles arcessere ventos?<br/>
> quos faciet nostra mota tabella manu.<br/>

*I suspect that from these things the rest might also please, which lie well hidden beneath the thin garment. Meanwhile, do you wish to summon gentle breezes? Our fan, moved by our hand, will create them.*

- suspicor, -ari - to suspect, surmise
- cetera (n. pl.) - the rest, the remaining things
- tenuis, -e - thin, fine, delicate
- condere - to hide, store, put away (condita - perfect passive participle)
- vestis, -is (f.) - garment, clothing, dress
- latere - to lie hidden, be concealed
- arcessere - to summon, send for, fetch
- tabella, -ae (f.) - small board, fan, writing tablet

The passage contains elegant sexual innuendo typical of Roman love poetry. The mention of "thin garment" (tenui veste) was a common erotic motif in classical literature, suggesting the partially revealed female form. The fan (tabella) mentioned was a common accessory in Roman times, particularly among wealthy women. These hand-held fans were often made of wood or precious materials and were used both for cooling and as fashion accessories. The creation of artificial breezes indoors was particularly important in the Roman world, where summers could be oppressively hot and air circulation in buildings was a constant concern. The gentle, suggestive tone of the questioning and the playful offer to create breezes reflects the refined, witty nature of Roman amatory verse.
> an magis hic meus est animi, non aeris aestus,<br/>
> captaque femineus pectora torret amor?<br/>
> dum loquor, alba levi sparsa est tibi pulvere vestis.<br/>
> sordide de niveo corpore pulvis abi!<br/>

*Or is this rather a fever of my mind, not of the air, and does feminine love scorch my captured heart? While I speak, your white garment has been sprinkled with light dust. Away, dirty dust, from her snow-white body!*

- aestus, -us (m.) - heat, fever, passion, turmoil
- torquere/torrere - to scorch, burn, torment
- femineus, -a, -um - feminine, womanly
- spargere - to scatter, sprinkle (sparsa est - perfect passive)
- niveus, -a, -um - snow-white, snowy
- sordidus, -a, -um - dirty, filthy, squalid
- pulvis, -eris (m.) - dust, powder

The passage reflects common themes in Roman love poetry, particularly the metaphorical connection between physical heat (aestus) and passionate love. The contrast between white (alba, niveo) and dirty (sordide) represents a common poetic device emphasizing purity versus contamination. The white garment (alba vestis) would likely have been a stola, the traditional dress of Roman women, or perhaps a palla, the outer garment. The description of the beloved's snow-white body (niveo corpore) follows conventional Latin poetic ideals of female beauty, where pale skin was considered attractive as it indicated high social status - someone who didn't need to work outdoors. The dramatic apostrophe to the dust in the final line is characteristic of the heightened emotional rhetoric of Roman love poetry.
> Sed iam pompa venit — linguis animisque favete!<br/>
> tempus adest plausus — aurea pompa venit.<br/>
> prima loco fertur passis Victoria pinnis —<br/>
> huc ades et meus hic fac, dea, vincat amor!<br/>

*But now the procession comes — be favorable with tongues and minds! The time for applause is here — the golden procession comes. Victory is carried first in place with spread wings — come here, goddess, and make my love here victorious!*

- pompa, -ae (f.) - procession, parade, pageant
- favere (+ dat.) - to be favorable to, support (used in religious contexts)
- passus - spread, extended, outspread
- pinna, -ae (f.) - wing, feather (variant of penna)
- Victoria, -ae (f.) - Victory (personified)
- adesse - to be present, assist, help
- vincere - to conquer, win, be victorious

The passage describes a ceremonial procession (pompa), which was a common feature of Roman religious and civic life. The phrase "linguis animisque favete" was a ritual formula calling for reverent silence and attention, commonly used at the start of religious ceremonies. The personification of Victory (Victoria) was an important concept in Roman culture - she was depicted as a winged goddess, often shown on coins and public monuments. The golden procession likely refers to an important state or religious ceremony, where statues and sacred objects would be carried through the streets. Such processions were elaborate affairs with participants wearing gold-decorated clothing and carrying golden implements. The call for applause indicates this was a public spectacle where audience participation was expected. The final invocation to the goddess reflects the Roman practice of seeking divine intervention in personal matters.
> plaudite Neptuno, nimium qui creditis undis!<br/>
> nil mihi cum pelago; me mea terra capit.<br/>
> plaude tuo Marti, miles! nos odimus arma;<br/>
> pax iuvat et media pace repertus amor.<br/>

*Applaud Neptune, you who trust too much in the waves! I want nothing to do with the sea; my land holds me. Applaud your Mars, soldier! We hate weapons; peace delights us and love discovered in the midst of peace.*

- plaudere - to applaud, clap for, give approval to
- nimium (adv.) - too much, excessively
- pelagus, -i (n.) - sea, ocean
- capere - to take, hold, contain (here: holds, keeps)
- Mars, Martis (m.) - Mars, god of war
- miles, militis (m.) - soldier
- odisse - to hate (defective verb)
- iuvare - to help, please, delight
- reperire - to find, discover (repertus - perfect participle)

The passage contrasts two divine patrons and their followers. Neptune (Poseidon in Greek mythology) was the god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses. Sailors and merchants would seek his protection for safe voyages. Mars was one of Rome's most important deities, the god of war and agriculture, and mythical father of Romulus and Remus. The Roman army had a special devotion to Mars.

The phrase "media pace" (in the midst of peace) reflects the Roman concept of pax, which meant more than just absence of war - it represented a state of ordered civilization and proper relationship between gods and humans. The Pax Romana was a long period of relative peace and stability in the Roman Empire.

The contrast between martial and peaceful pursuits was a common theme in Roman love poetry, where the poet often rejected traditional Roman military values in favor of love and peace. This represents a conscious subversion of traditional Roman virtues (virtus) that emphasized military prowess.
> auguribus Phoebus, Phoebe venantibus adsit!<br/>
> artifices in te verte, Minerva, manus!<br/>
> ruricolae, Cereri teneroque adsurgite Baccho!<br/>
> Pollucem pugiles, Castora placet eques!<br/>

*May Phoebus assist the augurs, may Phoebe assist the hunters! Turn your skilled hands to yourself, Minerva! Farmers, rise for Ceres and tender Bacchus! May boxers please Pollux, and horsemen Castor!*

- augur, -uris (m.) - religious official who interprets omens
- venator, -oris (m.) - hunter
- adesse - to be present, assist, help
- artifex, -icis (m./f.) - craftsperson, artist, expert
- ruricola, -ae (m.) - farmer, countryman
- adsurgere - to rise up (in respect), stand up for
- pugil, -ilis (m.) - boxer
- eques, -itis (m.) - horseman, knight

The passage invokes various Roman deities and their traditional spheres of influence. Phoebus Apollo was associated with prophecy and divination, while his sister Phoebe (Diana) was the goddess of hunting. Minerva was the patron deity of crafts and skilled work. Ceres was the goddess of agriculture and grain, while Bacchus (called "tender" here) was the god of wine and viticulture. The twin deities Castor and Pollux (the Dioscuri) were particularly important in Roman religion - Pollux was famous as a boxer, while Castor was known for his horsemanship. The poem shows how different professional groups in Roman society each had their patron deities. Augurs were particularly important religious officials who interpreted omens, especially the flight of birds, to determine whether the gods approved of proposed actions. The reference to "rising" for Ceres and Bacchus suggests the respectful standing that occurred during religious ceremonies or libations.
> nos tibi, blanda Venus, puerisque potentibus arcu<br/>
> plaudimus; inceptis adnue, diva, meis<br/>
> daque novae mentem dominae! patiatur amari!<br/>
> adnuit et motu signa secunda dedit.<br/>

*We applaud you, charming Venus, and the boys powerful with their bow; goddess, nod approval to my undertakings and grant a favorable disposition to my new mistress! May she allow herself to be loved! She nodded and gave favorable signs with her movement.*

- blandus, -a, -um - charming, seductive, flattering
- plaudere - to applaud, approve, clap for (plaudimus - present)
- adnuere - to nod in approval, assent (adnue - imperative; adnuit - perfect)
- inceptum, -i (n.) - undertaking, beginning, enterprise
- domina, -ae (f.) - mistress, lady (in elegiac poetry: the beloved)
- pati - to allow, suffer, endure (patiatur - present subjunctive)
- motus, -us (m.) - movement, motion, gesture
- secundus, -a, -um - favorable, following, second

The passage is a prayer to Venus, the goddess of love, and her companions, the Cupids (referred to as "boys powerful with their bow"). In Roman poetry, Venus was often addressed directly in matters of love, especially at the beginning of love affairs. The "boys with bows" are Cupids (Amores), divine beings who shoot arrows of love into mortals' hearts. The "new mistress" (nova domina) refers to a woman the speaker hopes to court - in Roman love poetry, the beloved was typically referred to as domina, indicating both affection and submission to her power. The goddess's response through nodding (adnuit) was considered a traditional sign of divine approval in ancient religion. The "favorable signs" (signa secunda) reflect the Roman practice of looking for omens in divine responses, a fundamental aspect of Roman religious practice.
> quod dea promisit, promittas ipsa, rogamus;<br/>
> pace loquar Veneris, tu dea maior eris.<br/>
> per tibi tot iuro testes pompamque deorum,<br/>
> te dominam nobis tempus in omne peti!<br/>

*What the goddess promised, we ask that you yourself promise; with Venus' peace be it spoken, you will be a greater goddess. I swear to you by all these witnesses and by the procession of the gods, that you are sought by us as mistress for all time!*

- pompa, -ae (f.) - procession, parade, pageant
- testis, -is (m/f.) - witness, one who testifies
- domina, -ae (f.) - mistress, lady (term of respect/endearment)
- tempus in omne - for all time (idiom)
- pace (+ genitive) - with the peace/permission of (formal expression)

The passage contains several elements typical of Roman religious and social customs. The reference to Venus indicates the divine sphere, where Venus was the goddess of love and beauty. The speaker uses a formal religious formula "pace Veneris" (with Venus' permission), which was a standard way of showing respect when making potentially presumptuous statements about deities. The "pompa deorum" refers to religious processions where images of gods were carried through the streets, a common feature of Roman religious festivals. The term "domina" was used both in love poetry and in religious contexts, showing the overlap between romantic and religious devotion in Roman culture. The practice of swearing by divine witnesses was a serious matter in Roman society, used to emphasize the gravity and sincerity of one's words.
> Sed pendent tibi crura. potes, si forte iuvabit,<br/>
> cancellis primos inseruisse pedes.<br/>
> maxima iam vacuo praetor spectacula circo<br/>
> quadriiugos aequo carcere misit equos.<br/>

*But your legs are dangling. You can, if perhaps it will help, put your feet through the front of the railings. Now in the empty circus the praetor has released the four-horse teams from the level starting gate for the grand spectacle.*

- pendere - to hang, dangle
- cancelli, -orum (m. pl.) - railings, lattice, barrier
- primus, -a, -um - first, front
- inserere - to insert, put in (inseruisse - perfect infinitive)
- spectaculum, -i (n.) - show, spectacle, sight
- quadriiugus, -a, -um - four-horsed, yoked four together
- carcer, -eris (m.) - starting gate (in circus context), prison
- aequus, -a, -um - level, fair, equal
- mittere - to send, release, let go

The passage describes a scene at a Roman circus (chariot racing stadium). The addressee appears to be sitting in the elevated seats with their legs hanging down over the barrier. The praetor was a Roman magistrate who, among other duties, would oversee public games and spectacles. The quadrigae (four-horse chariots) were the main event in Roman chariot racing. The carceres were a row of starting gates at one end of the circus that would open simultaneously to ensure a fair start. The "empty circus" suggests this is just before the start of the races when spectators would be finding their seats. The circus was the largest entertainment venue in Roman cities - the Circus Maximus in Rome could hold around 250,000 people. The spectators sat on long tiers of stone seats, often with railings or barriers for safety, as referenced in the text.
> cui studeas, video. vincet, cuicumque favebis.<br/>
> quid cupias, ipsi scire videntur equi.<br/>
> me miserum, metam spatioso circuit orbe!<br/>
> quid facis? admoto proxumus axe subit.<br/>

*I see whom you're cheering for. Whoever you favor will win. The horses themselves seem to know what you desire. Poor me, he's taking the turn post in a wide circle! What are you doing? He's approaching too close with his chariot drawn near.*

- studere (+ dat.) - to be eager for, support, cheer for
- favere - to favor, support, show partiality
- cupere - to desire, wish for, long for
- meta, -ae (f.) - turning post, goal post
- spatiosus, -a, -um - spacious, wide, extensive
- circus, -i (m.) - circle, circuit
- orbis, -is (m.) - circle, circuit, orbit
- axis, -is (m.) - axle, chariot (by metonymy)
- subire - to approach from below, come up to
- admovere - to move towards, bring near (admoto - ablative absolute)

The passage describes a scene at a chariot race in the Roman circus. The meta was one of two turning posts at either end of the circus around which chariots had to navigate - a crucial and dangerous point in the race. Taking too wide a turn (spatioso orbe) would lose time and position, while cutting too close risked collision. The axis refers to the chariot by metonymy (using a part to represent the whole). The emotional involvement of spectators in chariot racing was intense, with fans passionately supporting particular teams (typically identified by colors - Reds, Blues, Whites, and Greens). The speaker appears to be watching someone (probably a loved one) supporting a different charioteer than the one they favor, leading to their distress at the dangerous racing maneuver being attempted.
> quid facis, infelix? perdis bona vota puellae.<br/>
> tende, precor, valida lora sinistra manu!<br/>
> favimus ignavo — sed enim revocate, Quirites,<br/>
> et date iactatis undique signa togis!<br/>

*What are you doing, unfortunate one? You are ruining the girl's good wishes. Pull, I beg you, the left-hand reins with a strong hand! We supported a coward - but call him back, citizens, and give signals by waving your togas everywhere!*

- infelix, -icis - unfortunate, unhappy, ill-fated
- votum, -i (n.) - wish, prayer, vow
- tendere - to stretch, pull tight, direct
- lorum, -i (n.) - rein, strap, thong
- sinister, -tra, -trum - left, on the left side
- favere (+ dat.) - to support, favor, be favorable to
- ignavus, -a, -um - cowardly, lazy, worthless
- Quirites, -ium (m. pl.) - Roman citizens (formal address)
- iactare - to throw, toss, wave about
- toga, -ae (f.) - toga, Roman citizen's formal garment

The passage appears to be set at a public spectacle, likely a chariot race in the circus. The left-hand reins were particularly important in Roman chariot racing, as most races ran counter-clockwise around the circus, making the left turns crucial. The formal address to "Quirites" is significant - this was the ceremonial way to address Roman citizens in their civilian capacity, as opposed to addressing them as military personnel ("milites"). The waving of togas was a common way for Roman spectators to show approval or disapproval at public events - the toga being the distinctive dress of Roman citizenship. The scene captures the passionate involvement of Roman crowds in their public entertainments, where they would actively participate by showing their feelings about the competitors' performance.
> en, revocant! — ac ne turbet toga mota capillos,<br/>
> in nostros abdas te licet usque sinus.<br/>
> Iamque patent iterum reserato carcere postes;<br/>
> evolat admissis discolor agmen equis.<br/>

*Look, they're calling them back! And lest the moving toga disturb your hair, you may hide yourself deep in my embrace. And now the gates stand open again, the prison-barriers unlocked; the multi-colored troop flies forth with horses given free rein.*

- revocare - to call back, recall
- turbare - to disturb, throw into confusion
- abdere - to hide, conceal, put away
- sinus, -us (m.) - fold of a garment, lap, embrace
- carcer, -eris (m.) - prison, starting gates (in racing)
- reserare - to unlock, unbar, open
- postis, -is (m.) - doorpost, gate
- evolare - to fly out, rush forth
- admittere - to let go, give free rein to
- discolor - of different colors, multi-colored
- agmen, -inis (n.) - column, troop, train

The passage describes a scene at the Circus Maximus or similar Roman racetrack. The "carcer" refers to the starting gates where chariots were held before races. These were wooden stalls with gates that would spring open simultaneously. The "discolor agmen" refers to the racing teams, which were distinguished by different colors (traditionally Green, Blue, Red, and White in Roman chariot racing). The reference to the toga suggests this is taking place at a formal public event, as the toga was the required formal dress for Roman citizens at public spectacles. The detail about protecting one's hair from the toga implies the wind and excitement of the race's start. "Admissis equis" is a technical term from racing, referring to giving horses their head or full rein to run at maximum speed.
> nunc saltem supera spatioque insurge patenti!<br/>
> sint mea, sint dominae fac rata vota meae!<br/>
> Sunt dominae rata vota meae, mea vota supersunt.<br/>
> ille tenet palmam; palma petenda mea est.<br/>

*Now at least rise up and surge forward in the open space! Make my prayers be fulfilled, make my mistress's prayers be fulfilled! My mistress's prayers are fulfilled, my prayers remain unfulfilled. He holds the palm of victory; but the palm I must seek is my own.*

- superare - to rise above, overcome, surpass
- insurgere - to rise up, mount up, rebel
- patens, -entis - open, accessible, exposed
- ratus, -a, -um - ratified, valid, fulfilled
- votum, -i (n.) - prayer, wish, vow
- palma, -ae (f.) - palm branch, victory, prize
- petendus, -a, -um - to be sought, that must be sought

The palm branch (palma) was a widely recognized symbol of victory in Roman culture, awarded to winners in competitions and triumphant generals. This symbolism originated from Greek athletic contests but was adopted by Romans in both literal and metaphorical contexts. The gerundive "petenda" expresses necessity or obligation, a grammatical construction frequently used in Latin to convey moral or practical imperatives. The repeated mention of "vota" (prayers/wishes) reflects the Roman practice of making formal vows to deities, which were considered binding contracts with the gods. The spatial metaphor of rising up and moving through open space (spatium patens) draws on the Roman conception of physical and social mobility, where upward movement represented advancement and success. The contrast between the speaker's unfulfilled wishes and those of the "domina" (mistress/lady) suggests a power dynamic typical of Roman love poetry.
> Risit, et argutis quiddam promisit ocellis.<br/>
> Hoc satis est, alio cetera redde loco!

*She laughed, and promised something with her expressive eyes. "This is enough, give me the rest in another place!"*

- ridere - to laugh, smile (risit - perfect)
- argutus - bright, expressive, clear, witty
- quiddam - something, a certain thing
- ocellus, -i (m.) - little eye (diminutive of oculus)
- cetera (n. pl.) - the rest, the remaining things
- reddere - to give back, return, render

The passage captures a moment of flirtatious interaction typical in Roman love poetry. The use of diminutive ocelli (little eyes) instead of oculi is characteristic of intimate, affectionate language in Latin poetry. The woman's expressive eyes (arguti ocelli) communicate meaning without words, a motif common in ancient literature where nonverbal communication played a significant role in courtship. The command to continue elsewhere (alio loco) suggests a scene taking place in public, reflecting Roman social customs where open romantic interactions were often considered inappropriate. The playful tone and setting are characteristic of Roman love elegy, where such encounters are frequently described in urban settings with attention to subtle gestures and implied meanings.
